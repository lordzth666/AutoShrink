 a form of asbestos once used to make kent cigarette filters has caused a high percentage of cancer deaths among a group of workers exposed to it more than N years ago researchers reported 
 the asbestos fiber <unk> is unusually <unk> once it enters the <unk> with even brief exposures to it causing symptoms that show up decades later researchers said 
 <unk> inc. the unit of new york-based <unk> corp. that makes kent cigarettes stopped using <unk> in its <unk> cigarette filters in N 
 although preliminary findings were reported more than a year ago the latest results appear in today 's new england journal of medicine a forum likely to bring new attention to the problem 
 a <unk> <unk> said this is an old story 
 we 're talking about years ago before anyone heard of asbestos having any questionable properties 
 there is no asbestos in our products now 
 neither <unk> nor the researchers who studied the workers were aware of any research on smokers of the kent cigarettes 
 we have no useful information on whether users are at risk said james a. <unk> of boston 's <unk> cancer institute 
 dr. <unk> led a team of researchers from the national cancer institute and the medical schools of harvard university and boston university 
 the <unk> spokeswoman said asbestos was used in very modest amounts in making paper for the filters in the early 1950s and replaced with a different type of <unk> in N 
 from N to N N billion kent cigarettes with the filters were sold the company said 
 among N men who worked closely with the substance N have died more than three times the expected number 
 four of the five surviving workers have <unk> diseases including three with recently <unk> cancer 
 the total of N deaths from malignant <unk> lung cancer and <unk> was far higher than expected the researchers said 
 the <unk> rate is a striking finding among those of us who study <unk> diseases said dr. <unk> 
 the percentage of lung cancer deaths among the workers at the west <unk> mass. paper factory appears to be the highest for any asbestos workers studied in western industrialized countries he said 
 the plant which is owned by <unk> & <unk> co. was under contract with <unk> to make the cigarette filters 
 the finding probably will support those who argue that the u.s. should regulate the class of asbestos including <unk> more <unk> than the common kind of asbestos <unk> found in most schools and other buildings dr. <unk> said 
 the u.s. is one of the few industrialized nations that does n't have a higher standard of regulation for the smooth <unk> fibers such as <unk> that are classified as <unk> according to <unk> t. <unk> a professor of <unk> at the university of vermont college of medicine 
 more common <unk> fibers are <unk> and are more easily rejected by the body dr. <unk> explained 
 in july the environmental protection agency imposed a gradual ban on virtually all uses of asbestos 
 by N almost all remaining uses of <unk> asbestos will be outlawed 
 about N workers at a factory that made paper for the kent filters were exposed to asbestos in the 1950s 
 areas of the factory were particularly dusty where the <unk> was used 
 workers dumped large <unk> <unk> of the imported material into a huge <unk> poured in cotton and <unk> fibers and <unk> mixed the dry fibers in a process used to make filters 
 workers described clouds of blue dust that hung over parts of the factory even though <unk> fans <unk> the area 
 there 's no question that some of those workers and managers contracted <unk> diseases said <unk> phillips vice president of human resources for <unk> & <unk> 
 but you have to recognize that these events took place N years ago 
 it has no bearing on our work force today

 john rowe president and chief executive officer of new england electric said the company 's return on equity could suffer if it made a higher bid and its forecasts related to ps of new hampshire such as growth in electricity demand and improved operating <unk> did n't come true 
 when we <unk> raising our bid the risks seemed substantial and persistent over the next five years and the rewards seemed a long way out 
 that got hard to take he added 
 mr. rowe also noted that political concerns also worried new england electric 
 no matter who owns ps of new hampshire after it emerges from bankruptcy proceedings its rates will be among the highest in the nation he said 
 that attracts attention 
 it was just another one of the risk factors that led to the company 's decision to withdraw from the bidding he added 
 wilbur ross jr. of rothschild inc. the financial adviser to the troubled company 's equity holders said the withdrawal of new england electric might speed up the reorganization process 
 the fact that new england proposed lower rate increases N N over seven years against around N N boosts proposed by the other two outside bidders complicated negotiations with state officials mr. ross asserted

 commonwealth edison co. was ordered to refund about $ N million to its current and former <unk> for illegal rates collected for cost overruns on a nuclear power plant 
 the refund was about $ N million more than previously ordered by the illinois commerce commission and trade groups said it may be the largest ever required of a state or local utility 
 state court judge richard curry ordered edison to make average refunds of about $ N to $ N each to edison customers who have received electric service since april N including about two million customers who have moved during that period 
 judge curry ordered the refunds to begin feb. N and said that he would n't <unk> any appeals or other attempts to block his order by commonwealth edison 
 the refund pool may not be held <unk> through another round of appeals judge curry said 
 commonwealth edison said it is already appealing the underlying commission order and is considering appealing judge curry 's order 
 the exact amount of the refund will be determined next year based on actual <unk> made until dec. N of this year 
 commonwealth edison said the ruling could force it to slash its N earnings by $ N a share

 the illinois supreme court ordered the commission to audit commonwealth edison 's construction expenses and refund any <unk> expenses 
 the utility has been collecting for the plant 's construction cost from its N million customers subject to a refund since N 
 in august the commission ruled that between $ N million and $ N million of the plant 's construction cost was <unk> and should be <unk> plus interest

 the survival of spinoff cray computer corp. as a fledgling in the supercomputer business appears to depend heavily on the creativity and <unk> of its chairman and chief designer seymour cray 
 not only is development of the new company 's initial machine tied directly to mr. cray so is its balance sheet 
 documents filed with the securities and exchange commission on the pending spinoff disclosed that cray research inc. will withdraw the almost $ N million in financing it is providing the new firm if mr. cray leaves or if the <unk> project he heads is scrapped 
 the documents also said that although the <unk> mr. cray has been working on the project for more than six years the cray-3 machine is at least another year away from a fully operational prototype 
 moreover there have been no orders for the cray-3 so far though the company says it is talking with several prospects 
 while many of the risks were anticipated when <unk> cray research first announced the spinoff in may the <unk> it attached to the financing had n't been made public until yesterday 
 we did n't have much of a choice cray computer 's chief financial officer gregory <unk> said in an interview 
 the theory is that seymour is the chief designer of the cray-3 and without him it could not be completed 
 cray research did not want to fund a project that did not include seymour 
 the documents also said that cray computer anticipates <unk> perhaps another $ N million in financing beginning next september 
 but mr. <unk> called that a <unk> scenario 
 the filing on the details of the spinoff caused cray research stock to jump $ N yesterday to close at $ N in new york stock exchange composite trading 
 analysts noted yesterday that cray research 's decision to link its $ N million <unk> note to mr. cray 's presence will complicate a valuation of the new company 
 it has to be considered as an additional risk for the investor said gary p. <unk> of <unk> group inc. minneapolis 
 cray computer will be a concept stock he said 
 you either believe seymour can do it again or you do n't 
 besides the designer 's age other risk factors for mr. cray 's new company include the cray-3 's tricky <unk> chip technology 
 the sec documents describe those chips which are made of <unk> <unk> as being so fragile and minute they will require special <unk> handling equipment 
 in addition the cray-3 will contain N processors twice as many as the largest current supercomputer 
 cray computer also will face intense competition not only from cray research which has about N N of the world-wide supercomputer market and which is expected to roll out the <unk> machine a direct competitor with the cray-3 in N 
 the spinoff also will compete with international business machines corp. and japan 's big three hitachi ltd. nec corp. and fujitsu ltd 
 the new company said it believes there are fewer than N potential customers for <unk> priced between $ N million and $ N million presumably the cray-3 price range 
 under terms of the spinoff cray research stockholders are to receive one cray computer share for every two cray research shares they own in a distribution expected to occur in about two weeks 
 no price for the new shares has been set 
 instead the companies will leave it up to the marketplace to decide 
 cray computer has applied to trade on nasdaq 
 analysts calculate cray computer 's initial book value at about $ N a share 
 along with the note cray research is <unk> about $ N million in assets primarily those related to the cray-3 development which has been a drain on cray research 's earnings 
 <unk> balance sheets clearly show why cray research favored the spinoff 
 without the cray-3 research and development expenses the company would have been able to report a profit of $ N million for the first half of N rather than the $ N million it posted 
 on the other hand had it existed then cray computer would have incurred a $ N million loss 
 mr. cray who could n't be reached for comment will work for the new colorado springs colo. company as an independent contractor the arrangement he had with cray research 
 regarded as the father of the supercomputer mr. cray was paid $ N at cray research last year 
 at cray computer he will be paid $ N 
 besides messrs. cray and <unk> other senior management at the company includes neil <unk> N president and chief executive officer joseph m. <unk> N vice president engineering malcolm a. <unk> N vice president software and douglas r. <unk> N vice president hardware

 they will remain on a <unk> list that includes N other countries 
 those countries including japan italy canada greece and spain are still of some concern to the u.s. but are deemed to pose <unk> problems for american patent and copyright owners than those on the priority list 
 gary hoffman a washington lawyer specializing in <unk> cases said the threat of u.s. <unk> combined with a growing recognition that protecting intellectual property is in a country 's own interest prompted the improvements made by south korea taiwan and saudi arabia 
 what this tells us is that u.s. trade law is working he said 
 he said mexico could be one of the next countries to be removed from the priority list because of its efforts to craft a new patent law 
 mrs. hills said that the u.s. is still concerned about disturbing developments in turkey and continuing slow progress in malaysia

 earlier this year japanese investors snapped up a similar $ N million mortgage-backed securities mutual fund 
 that fund was put together by blackstone group a new york investment bank 
 the latest two funds were assembled jointly by goldman sachs & co. of the u.s. and japan 's daiwa securities co 
 the new seven-year funds one offering a fixed-rate return and the other with a floating-rate return linked to the london interbank offered rate offer two key advantages to japanese investors 
 first they are designed to eliminate the risk of prepayment mortgage-backed securities can be retired early if interest rates decline and such prepayment forces investors to <unk> their money at lower rates 
 second they channel monthly mortgage payments into semiannual payments reducing the administrative burden on investors 
 by addressing those problems mr. maxwell said the new funds have become extremely attractive to japanese and other investors outside the u.s. 
 such devices have boosted japanese investment in mortgage-backed securities to more than N N of the $ N billion in such instruments outstanding and their purchases are growing at a rapid rate 
 they also have become large purchasers of fannie mae 's corporate debt buying $ N billion in fannie mae bonds during the first nine months of the year or almost a <unk> of the total amount issued

 italian chemical giant montedison <unk> through its montedison acquisition n.v. indirect unit began its $ <unk> tender offer for all the common shares outstanding of erbamont n.v. a maker of pharmaceuticals incorporated in the netherlands 
 the offer advertised in today 's editions of the wall street journal is scheduled to expire at the end of november 
 montedison currently owns about N N of erbamont 's common shares outstanding 
 the offer is being launched <unk> to a previously announced agreement between the companies 
 japan 's reserves of gold convertible foreign currencies and special drawing rights fell by a hefty $ N billion in october to $ N billion the finance ministry said 
 the total marks the sixth consecutive monthly decline 
 the <unk> downturn reflects the intensity of bank of japan <unk> intervention since june when the u.s. currency temporarily surged above the N yen level 
 the announcement follows a sharper $ N billion decline in the country 's foreign reserves in september to $ N billion 
 pick a country any country 
 it 's the latest investment craze sweeping wall street a rash of new closed-end country funds those publicly traded portfolios that invest in stocks of a single foreign country 
 no fewer than N country funds have been launched or registered with regulators this year triple the level of all of N according to charles e. simon & co. a washington-based research firm 
 the turf recently has ranged from chile to <unk> to portugal 
 next week the philippine fund 's launch will be capped by a visit by philippine president <unk> aquino the first time a head of state has kicked off an issue at the big board here

 anything 's possible how about the new guinea fund <unk> george foot a managing partner at <unk> management associates of <unk> mass 
 the recent explosion of country funds <unk> the closed-end fund mania of the 1920s mr. foot says when narrowly focused funds grew wildly popular 
 they fell into <unk> after the N crash 
 unlike traditional <unk> mutual funds most of these <unk> portfolios are the closed-end type issuing a fixed number of shares that trade publicly 
 the surge brings to nearly N the number of country funds that are or soon will be listed in new york or london 
 these funds now account for several billions of dollars in assets 
 people are looking to stake their claims now before the number of available nations runs out says michael porter an analyst at smith barney harris upham & co. new york 
 behind all the <unk> is some <unk> competition 
 as individual investors have turned away from the stock market over the years securities firms have scrambled to find new products that brokers find easy to sell 
 and the firms are stretching their <unk> far and wide to do it 
 financial planners often urge investors to diversify and to hold a <unk> of international securities 
 and many emerging markets have <unk> more mature markets such as the u.s. and japan 
 country funds offer an easy way to get a taste of foreign stocks without the hard research of seeking out individual companies 
 but it does n't take much to get burned 
 political and currency gyrations can <unk> the funds 
 another concern the funds ' share prices tend to swing more than the broader market 
 when the stock market dropped nearly N N oct. N for instance the mexico fund plunged about N N and the spain fund fell N N 
 and most country funds were clobbered more than most stocks after the N crash 
 what 's so wild about the funds ' frenzy right now is that many are trading at historically fat premiums to the value of their underlying portfolios 
 after trading at an average discount of more than N N in late N and part of last year country funds currently trade at an average premium of N N 
 the reason share prices of many of these funds this year have climbed much more sharply than the foreign stocks they hold 
 it 's probably worth paying a premium for funds that invest in markets that are partially closed to foreign investors such as south korea some specialists say 
 but some european funds recently have skyrocketed spain fund has surged to a startling N N premium 
 it has been targeted by japanese investors as a good long-term play tied to N 's european economic integration 
 and several new funds that are n't even fully invested yet have jumped to trade at big premiums 
 i 'm very alarmed to see these rich <unk> says smith barney 's mr. porter 
 the newly <unk> premiums reflect the increasingly global marketing of some country funds mr. porter suggests 
 unlike many u.s. investors those in asia or europe seeking <unk> exposure may be less <unk> to paying higher prices for country funds 
 there may be an international viewpoint cast on the funds listed here mr. porter says 
 nonetheless plenty of u.s. analysts and money managers are <unk> at the <unk> trading levels of some country funds 
 they argue that u.s. investors often can buy american depositary receipts on the big stocks in many funds these so-called adrs represent shares of foreign companies traded in the u.s. 
 that way investors can essentially buy the funds without paying the premium 
 for people who insist on jumping in now to buy the funds <unk> 's mr. foot says the only advice i have for these folks is that those who come to the party late had better be ready to leave quickly 
 the u.s. and soviet union are holding technical talks about possible repayment by moscow of $ N million in <unk> russian debts owed to the u.s. government the state department said 
 if the debts are repaid it could clear the way for soviet bonds to be sold in the u.s. 
 however after two meetings with the soviets a state department spokesman said that it 's too early to say whether that will happen 
 <unk> with the talks the state department said it has permitted a soviet bank to open a new york branch 
 the branch of the bank for foreign economic affairs was approved last spring and opened in july 
 but a soviet bank here would be <unk> unless moscow found a way to settle the $ N million debt which was lent to the country 's short-lived democratic <unk> government before the communists seized power in N 
 under a N law the johnson debt default act as amended it 's illegal for americans to extend credit to countries in default to the u.s. government unless they are members of the world bank and international monetary fund 
 the u.s.s.r. belongs to neither organization 
 moscow has settled <unk> debts with other countries in recent years at less than face value 
 the state department stressed the <unk> debts as the key to satisfying the johnson act 
 but the soviets might still face legal obstacles to raising money in the u.s. until they settle hundreds of millions of dollars in additional debt still outstanding from the world war ii <unk> program 
 in another reflection that the growth of the economy is <unk> off the government said that orders for manufactured goods and spending on construction failed to rise in september 
 meanwhile the national association of purchasing management said its latest survey indicated that the manufacturing economy contracted in october for the sixth consecutive month 
 its index inched up to N N in october from N N in september 
 any reading below N N suggests the manufacturing sector is generally declining 
 the purchasing managers however also said that orders turned up in october after four months of decline 
 factories booked $ N billion in orders in september nearly the same as the $ N billion in august the commerce department said 
 if not for a N N surge in orders for capital goods by defense contractors factory orders would have fallen N N 
 in a separate report the department said construction spending ran at an annual rate of $ N billion not significantly different from the $ N billion reported for august 
 private construction spending was down but government building activity was up 
 the figures in both reports were adjusted to remove the effects of usual seasonal patterns but were n't adjusted for inflation 
 kenneth <unk> economist for society corp. a cleveland bank said demand for exports of factory goods is beginning to <unk> off 
 at the same time the drop in interest rates since the spring has failed to revive the residential construction industry 
 what sector is stepping forward to pick up the slack he asked 
 i draw a blank 
 by most measures the nation 's industrial sector is now growing very slowly if at all 
 factory <unk> fell in september 
 so did the federal reserve board 's <unk> index 
 yet many economists are n't predicting that the economy is about to slip into recession 
 they cite a lack of imbalances that provide early warning signals of a downturn 
 inventories are closely watched for such clues for instance 
 economists say a buildup in inventories can <unk> cutbacks in production that can lead to a recession 
 but yesterday 's factory orders report had good news on that front it said factory inventories fell N N in september the first decline since february N 
 this <unk> to the soft landing scenario said elliott <unk> an economist at donaldson lufkin & jenrette securities corp 
 i do n't see any signs that inventories are excessive 
 a soft landing is an economic slowdown that <unk> inflation without leading to a recession 
 the department said orders for <unk> goods those intended to last fewer than three years fell N N in september to $ N billion after climbing N N the month before 
 orders for durable goods were up N N to $ N billion after rising N N the month before 
 the department previously estimated that <unk> orders fell N N in september 
 factory shipments fell N N to $ N billion after rising N N in august 
 shipments have been relatively level since january the commerce department noted 
 manufacturers ' backlogs of unfilled orders rose N N in september to $ N billion helped by strength in the defense capital goods sector 
 excluding these orders backlogs declined N N 
 in its construction spending report the commerce department said residential construction which accounts for nearly half of all construction spending was off N N in september to an annual rate of $ N billion 
 david <unk> economist for the mortgage bankers association predicted the drop in interest rates eventually will boost spending on single-family homes but probably not until early next year 
 spending on private <unk> construction was off N N to an annual rate of $ N billion with no sector showing strength 
 government construction spending rose N N to $ N billion 
 after adjusting for inflation the commerce department said construction spending did n't change in september 
 for the first nine months of the year total construction spending ran about N N above last year 's level 
 the government 's construction spending figures contrast with a report issued earlier in the week by mcgraw-hill inc. 's <unk> dodge group 
 dodge reported an N N increase in construction contracts awarded in september 
 the <unk> counts money as it is spent dodge counts contracts when they are awarded 
 the government includes money spent on residential <unk> dodge does n't 
 although the purchasing managers ' index continues to indicate a slowing economy it is n't <unk> an imminent recession said robert <unk> chairman of the association 's survey committee and director of materials management at pitney bowes inc. stamford conn 
 he said the index would have to be in the low N N range for several months to be considered a forecast of recession 
 the report offered new evidence that the nation 's export growth though still continuing may be slowing 
 only N N of the purchasing managers reported better export orders in october down from N N in september 
 and N N said export orders were down last month compared with N N the month before 
 the <unk> managers ' report also added evidence that inflation is under control 
 for the fifth consecutive month purchasing managers said prices for the goods they purchased fell 
 the decline was even <unk> than in september 
 they also said that vendors were delivering goods more quickly in october than they had for each of the five previous months 
 economists consider that a sign that <unk> pressures are <unk> 
 when demand is stronger than suppliers can handle and delivery times <unk> prices tend to rise 
 the purchasing managers ' report is based on data provided by more than N purchasing executives 
 each of the survey 's indicators <unk> the difference between the number of purchasers reporting improvement in a particular area and the number reporting a worsening 
 for the first time the october survey polled members on imports 
 it found that of the N N who import N N said they imported more in october and N N said they imported less than the previous month 
 while acknowledging one month 's figures do n't prove a trend mr. <unk> said it does lead you to suspect imports are going down or at least not increasing that much 
 items listed as being in short supply numbered only about a dozen but they included one <unk> milk and milk <unk> 
 it 's an odd thing to put on the list mr. <unk> noted 
 he said that for the second month in a row food processors reported a shortage of <unk> dry milk 
 they blamed increased demand for dairy products at a time of exceptionally high u.s. exports of dry milk coupled with very low import quotas

 it 's probably true that many <unk> put in <unk> overtime just for the <unk> of solidarity that the system is so <unk> that only the assistant manager can talk to the manager and the manager to the general manager and that sony was <unk> of letting a young short-term american employee take on any responsibility 
 all of this must have been <unk> frustrating to mr. <unk> who went to sony with degrees in business and computer science and was <unk> to <unk> another <unk>

 this is the year the negative ad for years a secondary presence in most political campaigns became the main event 
 the irony is that the attack commercial after getting a boost in last year 's presidential campaign has come of age in an <unk> election year with only a few <unk> scattered across the country 
 but in the three leading political <unk> of N the negative ads have reached new levels of <unk> raising fears that this kind of <unk> empty of significant issues is <unk> in a new era of campaigns without content 
 now says joseph <unk> a pioneer in political television the idea is to attack first last and always 
 a trend that started with the first <unk> of politics accelerated with the <unk> of the television age and became a <unk> art form in N has reached an entirely new stage 
 to get people 's attention these days says douglas <unk> a political consultant your tv ad needs to be bold and entertaining and more often than not that means <unk> 
 and unlike a few years ago you do n't even have to worry whether the ad is <unk> 
 in N as often as not the principal fights in the major campaigns are prompted by the ads themselves 
 take a look then at the main attack commercials that set the tone for tuesday 's elections in new york city new jersey and virginia 
 new york city 
 the screen <unk> with a small tight <unk> shot of david dinkins democratic candidate for mayor of new york city 
 david dinkins failed to file his income taxes for four straight years says a <unk> male voice 
 and then this television commercial paid for by republican rudolph giuliani 's campaign and produced by roger <unk> the master of negative tv ads really gets down to business 
 mr. dinkins the ad charges also failed to report his campaign contributions accurately <unk> his links to a failing insurance company and paid a convicted <unk> through a phony organization with no members no receipts and no office 
 david dinkins says the <unk> why does he always wait until he 's caught 
 nasty <unk> says john <unk> mr. dinkins 's issues director designed to <unk> a case of political corruption that simply does n't exist 
 <unk> by the giuliani ads mr. dinkins 's tv consultants robert <unk> and david <unk> finally <unk> a negative ad of their own 
 the screen shows two distorted <unk> photos presumably of two politicians 
 compare two candidates for mayor says the announcer 
 one says he 's for banning <unk> bullets 
 the other has opposed a ban on <unk> bullets 
 one claims he 's pro-choice 
 the other has opposed a woman 's right to choose 
 funny thing says the <unk> both these candidates are named rudolph giuliani 
 who 's telling the truth 
 everybody and nobody 
 it 's a classic situation of ads that are true but not always fully accurate 
 mr. dinkins did fail to file his income taxes for four years but he insists he voluntarily admitted the oversight when he was being considered for a city job 
 he was on the board of an insurance company with financial problems but he insists he made no secret of it 
 the city 's campaign finance board has refused to pay mr. dinkins $ N in matching funds because his campaign records are incomplete 
 the campaign has blamed these reporting problems on computer errors 
 and says mr. dinkins he did n't know the man his campaign paid for a <unk> effort had been convicted of <unk> 
 but say mr. dinkins 's managers he did have an office and his organization did have members 
 mr. giuliani 's campaign chairman peter powers says the dinkins ad is deceptive 
 the other side he argues knows giuliani has always been pro-choice even though he has personal reservations 
 they know he is generally opposed to <unk> bullets but that he had some reservations about the language in the legislation 
 virginia 
 democratic <unk> gov. douglas wilder opened his gubernatorial battle with republican marshall coleman with an abortion commercial produced by frank <unk> that analysts of every political <unk> agree was a tour de force 
 against a shot of <unk> <unk> on an american flag an announcer talks about the strong tradition of freedom and individual liberty that <unk> have <unk> for generations 
 then just as an image of the <unk> of thomas jefferson <unk> from the screen the announcer continues on the issue of abortion marshall coleman wants to take away your right to choose and give it to the politicians 
 that commercial which said mr. coleman wanted to take away the right of abortion even in cases of rape and incest a charge mr. coleman denies changed the dynamics of the campaign <unk> it at least in part into a <unk> on abortion 
 the ad prompted mr. coleman the former virginia attorney general to launch a series of advertisements created by bob goodman and designed to shake mr. wilder 's support among the very women who were attracted by the abortion ad 
 the coleman <unk> featured a <unk> of a young woman in <unk> and the ad suggested that she was <unk> an <unk> courtroom <unk> 
 a voice says <unk> now do n't you have <unk> 
 then an announcer <unk> it was douglas wilder who introduced a bill to force rape victims age N and younger to be <unk> about their private lives by lawyers for accused <unk> 
 so the next time mr. wilder talks about the rights of women ask him about this law he tried to pass 
 mr. wilder did introduce such legislation N years ago but he did so at the request of a <unk> a common legislative technique used by lawmakers 
 the legislation itself noted that it was introduced by request and in N mr. wilder introduced a bill to protect rape victims from <unk> <unk> 
 people have grown tired of these ads and coleman has gotten the <unk> of being a negative <unk> says mark <unk> a political scientist at mary washington college 
 wilder has managed to get across the idea that coleman will say anything to get elected governor and more important has been able to put the <unk> for all the negative <unk> on coleman 
 mr. coleman said this week that he would devote the remainder of the political season to positive <unk> but the truce lasted only hours 
 by tuesday night television stations were carrying new ads featuring mr. coleman himself raising questions about mr. wilder 's <unk> to rape victims 
 new jersey 
 the attacks began when democratic rep. james florio aired an ad featuring a drawing of <unk> and a photograph of mr. florio 's rival republican rep. jim courter 
 remember <unk> says a female voice 
 consider jim courter 
 and then this commercial produced by bob <unk> gets down to its own mean and <unk> business 
 pictures of <unk> oil <unk> <unk> into focus and the female voice <unk> that hazardous waste on his mr. courter 's property the neighbors are suing for consumer fraud 
 and the nose on mr. courter 's face grows 
 the only fraud involved cry mr. courter 's <unk> is the florio commercial itself and so the courter campaign has responded with its own <unk> commercial produced by mr. <unk> 
 in this one the screen <unk> with photographs of both candidates 
 who 's really lying asks a female voice 
 florio 's lying the voice goes on because the barrel on courter 's land contained heating oil was <unk> up and caused no pollution 
 mr. courter 's long nose <unk> while mr. florio 's grows 
 who 's telling the truth 
 stephen <unk> a political scientist at new jersey 's <unk> institute says it 's another example of an ad that 's true but not fully accurate 
 barrels were dumped on the courter property a complaint was made but there is no evidence the barrels were a serious threat to the environment 
 even so according to mr. <unk> the ad was devastating because it raised questions about mr. courter 's credibility 
 but it 's building on a long tradition 
 in N on route to a re-election rout of democrat frank <unk> gop gov. nelson rockefeller of new york appeared in person saying if you want to keep the crime rates high <unk> is your man

 japanese investment in southeast asia is <unk> the region toward economic integration 
 interviews with analysts and business people in the u.s. suggest that japanese capital may produce the economic cooperation that southeast asian politicians have pursued in fits and starts for decades 
 but japan 's power in the region also is <unk> fears of domination and <unk> fresh policy questions 
 the flow of japanese funds has set in motion a process <unk> these economies will be <unk> together by the great japanese investment machine says robert <unk> vice chairman of goldman sachs international corp 
 in the past five years japanese companies have tripled their commitments in asia to $ N billion 
 in thailand for example the government 's board of investment approved $ N million of japanese investment in N N times the u.s. investment figure for the year 
 japan 's commitment in southeast asia also includes steep increases in foreign assistance and trade 
 asia 's other <unk> countries are following japan 's lead and pumping capital into the region 
 in taiwan and south korea rising wages are forcing manufacturers to seek other overseas sites for <unk> production 
 these nations known as asia 's little <unk> also are contributing to southeast asia 's integration but their influence will remain subordinate to japan 's 
 for <unk> countries such as thailand and malaysia the investment will provide needed jobs and spur growth 
 but asian nations ' harsh memories of their military domination by japan in the early part of this century make them fearful of falling under japanese economic <unk> now 
 because of budget constraints in washington the u.s. encourages japan to share economic burdens in the region 
 but it <unk> yielding political ground 
 in the coming decade analysts say <unk> relations will be tested as tokyo comes to terms with its new status as the region 's economic <unk> 
 japan 's swelling investment in southeast asia is part of its economic evolution 
 in the past decade japanese manufacturers concentrated on domestic production for export 
 in the 1990s spurred by rising labor costs and the strong yen these companies will increasingly turn themselves into <unk> with plants around the world 
 to capture the investment southeast asian nations will move to accommodate japanese business 
 these nations ' internal decisions will be made in a way not to <unk> their largest aid <unk> largest private investor and largest lender says richard <unk> director of the international business and research program at the university of southern california 's graduate school of business 
 japanese money will help turn southeast asia into a more <unk> economic region 
 but analysts say asian cooperation is n't likely to parallel the european common market approach 
 rather japanese investment will spur integration of certain sectors says kent <unk> a specialist in east asian economies at the <unk> wilson school for public and <unk> affairs at princeton university 
 in electronics for example a japanese company might make television picture <unk> in japan <unk> the sets in malaysia and export them to indonesia 
 the effect will be to pull asia together not as a common market but as an integrated production zone says goldman sachs 's mr. <unk> 
 countries in the region also are beginning to consider a <unk> for closer economic and political ties 
 the economic and foreign ministers of N asian and pacific nations will meet in australia next week to discuss global trade issues as well as regional matters such as transportation and telecommunications 
 participants will include the u.s. australia canada japan south korea and new zealand as well as the six members of the association of southeast asian nations thailand malaysia singapore indonesia the philippines and <unk> 
 in addition the u.s. this year offered its own plan for cooperation around the pacific <unk> in a major speech by secretary of state james baker following up a proposal made in january by australian prime minister bob <unk> 
 the baker proposal <unk> washington 's intention to continue playing a leading political role in the region 
 in asia as in europe a new order is taking shape mr. baker said 
 the u.s. with its regional friends must play a crucial role in designing its architecture 
 but maintaining u.s. influence will be difficult in the face of japanese dominance in the region 
 japan not only <unk> the u.s. in investment flows but also <unk> it in trade with most southeast asian countries although the u.s. remains the leading trade partner for all of asia 
 moreover the japanese government now the world 's largest aid <unk> is pumping far more assistance into the region than the u.s. is 
 while u.s. officials voice optimism about japan 's <unk> role in asia they also convey an <unk> of caution 
 there 's an understanding on the part of the u.s. that japan has to expand its functions in asia says j. michael <unk> undersecretary of commerce for trade 
 if they approach it with a <unk> <unk> attitude there will be a net gain for everyone 
 some asian nations are <unk> about washington 's demand that tokyo step up its military spending to ease the u.s. security burden in the region 
 the issue is further complicated by uncertainty over the future of the u.s. 's leases on military bases in the philippines and by a possible u.s. troop reduction in south korea 
 many <unk> regard a u.s. presence as a desirable <unk> to japanese influence 
 no one wants the u.s. to pick up its <unk> and go home mr. <unk> says 
 for their part taiwan and south korea are expected to step up their own investments in the next decade to try to slow the japanese <unk> 
 they do n't want japan to <unk> the region and <unk> it up says <unk> lee professor of east asian politics at the university of pennsylvania 
 <unk> rice could hardly believe her eyes 
 while giving the comprehensive test of basic skills to ninth <unk> at greenville high school last march N she spotted a student looking at <unk> sheets 
 she had seen cheating before but these notes were <unk> 
 a <unk> is an example of a profession in trade and finance 
 at the end of world war ii germany surrendered before japan 
 the <unk> conference committee is used when a bill is passed by the house and senate in different forms 
 virtually word for word the notes matched questions and answers on the <unk> section of the test the student was taking 
 in fact the student had the answers to almost all of the N questions in that section 
 the student surrendered the notes but not without a protest 
 my teacher said it was ok for me to use the notes on the test he said 
 the teacher in question was nancy yeargin considered by many students and parents to be one of the best at the school 
 confronted mrs. yeargin admitted she had given the questions and answers two days before the examination to two <unk> geography classes 
 she had gone so far as to display the questions on an overhead <unk> and <unk> the answers 
 mrs. yeargin was fired and prosecuted under an unusual south carolina law that makes it a crime to breach test security 
 in september she pleaded guilty and paid a $ N fine 
 her alternative was N days in jail 
 her story is partly one of personal <unk> 
 she was an <unk> teacher who won <unk> and inspired students but she will probably never teach again 
 in her wake she left the <unk> and anger of a principal who was her friend and now calls her a <unk> of colleagues who say she brought them shame of students and parents who defended her and insist she was treated <unk> and of <unk> officials stunned that despite the <unk> nature of her actions she became something of a local <unk> 
 mrs. yeargin 's case also <unk> some light on the dark side of school reform where pressures on teachers are growing and where <unk> testing has enhanced the temptation to <unk> 
 the N statute mrs. yeargin violated was designed to enforce provisions of south carolina 's <unk> laws 
 prosecutors alleged that she was trying to bolster students ' scores to win a bonus under the state 's N education improvement act 
 the bonus depended on her ability to produce higher <unk> scores 
 there is incredible pressure on school systems and teachers to raise test scores says walt <unk> an education professor and testing specialist at boston college 
 so efforts to beat the tests are also on the rise 
 and most disturbing it is educators not students who are blamed for much of the wrongdoing 
 a <unk> study released in september by friends for education an <unk> n.m. <unk> group concluded that outright cheating by american educators is common 
 the group says standardized achievement test scores are greatly inflated because teachers often teach the test as mrs. yeargin did although most are never caught 
 evidence of widespread cheating has surfaced in several states in the last year or so 
 california 's education department suspects adult responsibility for <unk> at N schools that changed wrong answers to right ones on a statewide test 
 after numerous <unk> of questionable teacher help to students texas is <unk> its security practices 
 and sales of <unk> booklets for classroom instruction are booming 
 these materials including <unk> school publishing co. 's scoring high and learning materials are nothing short of sophisticated <unk> sheets according to some recent academic research 
 by using them teachers with administrative blessing telegraph to students <unk> the precise areas on which a test will concentrate and sometimes give away a few exact questions and answers 
 use of scoring high is widespread in south carolina and common in greenville county mrs. yeargin 's school district 
 experts say there is n't another state in the country where tests mean as much as they do in south carolina 
 under the state 's education improvement act low test scores can block students ' promotions or force entire districts into <unk> <unk> <unk> that can mean <unk> 
 high test scores on the other hand bring recognition and extra money a new computer lab for a school grants for special projects a bonus for the <unk> 
 and south carolina says it is getting results 
 since the reforms went in place for example no state has posted a higher rate of improvement on the <unk> <unk> test than south carolina although the state still posts the lowest average score of the about N states who use the sat as the primary college <unk> examination 
 critics say south carolina is paying a price by stressing improved test scores so much 
 friends of education rates south carolina one of the worst seven states in its study on academic cheating 
 says the organization 's founder john <unk> <unk> mrs. yeargin is a way for administrators to protect themselves and look like they take cheating seriously when in fact they do n't take it seriously at all 
 paul <unk> director of testing for the south carolina department of education says mr. <unk> 's allegations of cheating are <unk> without foundation and based on unfair <unk> 
 partly because of worries about potential abuse however he says the state will begin keeping closer track of <unk> preparation booklets next spring 
 south carolina 's reforms were designed for schools like greenville high school 
 standing on a <unk> hill in a <unk> area of this old textile city the school has educated many of south carolina 's best and <unk> including the state 's last two governors nobel prize winning <unk> charles <unk> and actress <unk> <unk> 
 but by the early 1980s its glory had faded like the yellow bricks of its broad <unk> 
 it was full of violence and gangs and kids cutting class says linda ward the school 's principal 
 crime was awful test scores were low and there was no <unk> in <unk> programs 
 mrs. ward took over in N becoming the school 's seventh principal in N years 
 her immediate predecessor suffered a nervous breakdown 
 prior to his term a teacher <unk> to death in the halls <unk> by a student 
 <unk> mrs. ward says the school was having trouble serving in harmony its two <unk> and evenly split student groups a <unk> white elite from old <unk> neighborhoods and blacks many of them poor from <unk> inner city neighborhoods 
 mrs. ward resolved to clean out <unk> in the school 's faculty and restore safety and she also had some new factors working in her behalf 
 one was statewide school reform which raised overall educational funding and <unk> in a new public spirit for school <unk> 
 another was nancy yeargin who came to greenville in N full of the energy and ambitions that reformers wanted to reward 
 being a teacher just became my life says the <unk> mrs. yeargin a teacher for N years before her dismissal 
 i loved the school its history 
 i even <unk> about school and new things to do with my students 
 while mrs. ward fired and restructured staff and struggled to improve <unk> mrs. yeargin worked <unk> days and fast became a student favorite 
 in N and N she applied for and won bonus pay under the reform law 
 encouraged by mrs. ward mrs. yeargin taught honor students in the state teacher <unk> program a reform creation designed to encourage good students to consider teaching as a career 
 she won grant money for the school advised <unk> ran the <unk> club proposed and taught a new cultural <unk> class in western <unk> and was chosen by the school <unk> as teacher of the year 
 she was an <unk> lady she had it all together says <unk> <unk> a freshman at the university of south carolina who had mrs. yeargin in the <unk> class last year 
 she says that because of mrs. yeargin she gave up ambitions in architecture and is studying to become a teacher 
 mary beth <unk> a greenville <unk> <unk> also says mrs. yeargin inspired her to go into education 
 she taught us more in western <unk> than i 've ever learned in other classes says <unk> green a greenville senior 
 in the classroom students say mrs. yeargin distinguished herself by <unk> teaching approaches forcing kids to pair up to complete classroom work or using <unk> type <unk> 
 on <unk> she came to work to prepare study plans or sometimes even to polish the furniture in her classroom 
 she just never gave it up says mary <unk> mary beth 's mother 
 you 'd see her <unk> <unk> in the stands at a football game 
 some fellow teachers however viewed mrs. yeargin as <unk> and too yielding to students 
 mrs. ward says she often defended her to colleagues who called her a <unk> 
 pressures began to build 
 friends told her she was pushing too hard 
 because of deteriorating hearing she told colleagues she feared she might not be able to teach much longer 
 mrs. yeargin 's extra work was also helping her earn points in the state 's <unk> program 
 but the most important source of points was student improvement on tests 
 huge gains by her students in N and N meant a total of $ N in bonuses over two years a meaningful addition to her annual salary of $ N 
 winning a bonus for a third year was n't that important to her mrs. yeargin insists 
 but others at greenville high say she was eager to win if not for money then for pride and recognition 
 mary elizabeth <unk> another <unk> teacher says she believed mrs. yeargin wanted to keep her standing high so she could get a new job that would n't demand good hearing 
 indeed mrs. yeargin was interested in a possible job with the state teacher <unk> program 
 last march after attending a teaching <unk> in washington mrs. yeargin says she returned to greenville two days before annual testing feeling that she had n't prepared her <unk> geography students adequately 
 when test booklets were passed out N hours ahead of time she says she <unk> questions in the social studies section and gave the answers to students 
 mrs. yeargin admits she made a big mistake but insists her <unk> were correct 
 i was trying to help kids in an unfair testing situation she says 
 only five of the N questions were geography questions 
 the rest were history <unk> finance subjects they never had 
 mrs. yeargin says that she also wanted to help lift greenville high school 's overall test scores usually near the bottom of N district high schools in <unk> carried annually by local newspapers 
 mostly she says she wanted to prevent the damage to <unk> that her <unk> students would suffer from doing badly on the test 
 these kids broke my heart she says 
 a whole day goes by and no one even knows they 're alive 
 they desperately needed somebody who showed they <unk> for them who loved them 
 the last thing they needed was another <unk> blow 
 school officials and prosecutors say mrs. yeargin is lying 
 they found students in an advanced class a year earlier who said she gave them similar help although because the case was n't tried in court this evidence was never presented publicly 
 that pretty much <unk> any <unk> that she was out to help the poor <unk> child says joe watson the prosecutor in the case who is also president of greenville high school 's <unk> association 
 mrs. yeargin concedes that she went over the questions in the earlier class adding i wanted to help all students 
 mr. watson says mrs. yeargin never complained to school officials that the standardized test was unfair 
 do i have much <unk> for her mr. watson asks 
 not really 
 i believe in the system 
 i believe you have to use the system to change it 
 what she did was like taking the law into your own hands 
 mrs. ward says that when the cheating was discovered she wanted to avoid the <unk> public disclosure that a trial would bring 
 she says she offered mrs. yeargin a quiet resignation and thought she could help save her teaching certificate 
 mrs. yeargin declined 
 she said something like you just want to make it easy for the school 
 i was <unk> mrs. ward recalls 
 it was like someone had turned a <unk> in me 
 to the <unk> and <unk> of her <unk> and legal authorities and perhaps as a measure of the <unk> of standardized tests <unk> yeargin won widespread local support 
 the <unk> hearing at which she was dismissed was crowded with students teachers and parents who came to testify on her behalf 
 supportive callers <unk> unfair testing not mrs. yeargin on a local radio talk show on which she appeared 
 the show did n't give the <unk> of mrs. yeargin 's <unk> saying only that she helped students do better on the test 
 the message to the board of education out of all this is we 've got to take a serious look at how we 're doing our <unk> and our testing policies in this state said the <unk> host 
 <unk> in the greenville newspaper allowed that mrs. yeargin was wrong but also said the case showed how testing was being <unk> 
 the radio show <unk> us says mrs. ward 
 partly because of the show mr. watson says the district decided not to recommend mrs. yeargin for a first-time offenders program that could have <unk> the charges and the conviction from her record 
 and legal authorities <unk> up an investigation worthy of a murder case 
 over N witnesses mostly students were interviewed 
 at greenville high school meanwhile some students especially on the <unk> <unk> were crushed 
 it 's hard to explain to a <unk> why someone they like had to go says mrs. ward 
 soon <unk> appeared in the <unk> that carried the school 's familiar <unk> <unk> <unk> on the front 
 on the back the shirts read we have all the answers 
 many colleagues are angry at mrs. yeargin 
 she did a lot of harm says <unk> rice who had discovered the <unk> notes 
 we work damn hard at what we do for damn little pay and what she did cast unfair <unk> on all of us 
 but several teachers also say the incident <unk> doubt on the wisdom of evaluating teachers or schools by using standardized test scores 
 says <unk> key a <unk> teacher the incentive pay thing has opened up a can of <unk> 
 there may be others doing what she did 
 mrs. yeargin says she pleaded guilty because she realized it would no longer be possible to win <unk> and because she was afraid of further charges 
 mrs. ward for one was relieved 
 despite the strong evidence against mrs. yeargin popular sentiment was so strong in her favor mrs. ward says that i 'm afraid a jury would n't have convicted her 
 since <unk> first touched slate <unk> have wanted to know what 's on the test 
 these days students can often find the answer in <unk> <unk> and <unk> their teachers give them in the weeks prior to taking standardized achievement tests 
 the <unk> section of the widely used california achievement test asks fifth <unk> what is another name for the roman <unk> <unk> 
 it also asks them to add <unk> and <unk> 
 <unk> in a <unk> <unk> called learning materials sold to schools across the country by <unk> school publishing co. contain the same questions 
 in many other <unk> there is almost no difference between the real test and learning materials 
 what 's more the test and learning materials are both produced by the same company <unk> a joint venture of mcgraw-hill inc. and macmillan 's parent britain 's maxwell communication corp 
 close parallels between tests and practice tests are common some educators and researchers say 
 <unk> booklets software and <unk> are a booming publishing <unk> 
 but some practice products are so similar to the tests themselves that critics say they represent a form of <unk> cheating 
 if i took these preparation booklets into my classroom i 'd have a hard time <unk> to my students and parents that it was n't cheating says john <unk> a <unk> city mich. teacher who has studied test <unk> 
 he and other critics say such <unk> aids can defeat the purpose of standardized tests which is to gauge learning progress 
 it 's as if france decided to give only french history questions to students in a european history class and when everybody <unk> the test they say their kids are good in european history says john <unk> an <unk> n.m. <unk> and founder of an educational research organization friends for education which has studied standardized testing 
 standardized achievement tests are given about N million times a year across the country to students generally from <unk> through eighth grade 
 the most widely used of these tests are <unk> 's cat and comprehensive test of basic skills the iowa test of basic skills by <unk> <unk> co. and <unk> <unk> <unk> inc. 's metropolitan achievement test and stanford achievement test 
 sales figures of the <unk> materials are n't known but their reach into schools is significant 
 in arizona california florida louisiana maryland new jersey south carolina and texas educators say they are common classroom tools 
 <unk> says well over N million of its scoring high <unk> books have been sold since their introduction N years ago with most sales in the last five years 
 about N sets of learning materials teachers ' <unk> have also been sold in the past four years 
 the materials in each set reach about N students 
 scoring high and learning materials are the <unk> preparation tests 
 michael kean director of marketing for <unk> <unk> the <unk> division that publishes learning materials says it is n't aimed at improving test scores 
 he also asserted that exact questions were n't <unk> 
 when referred to the questions that matched he said it was <unk> 
 mr. <unk> the <unk> and william <unk> a michigan state university education professor concluded in a study last june that cat test versions of scoring high and learning materials should n't be used in the classroom because of their similarity to the actual test 
 they devised a <unk> scale <unk> one point for each <unk> measured on the cat test to rate the <unk> of test <unk> to the <unk> cat 
 because many of these <unk> the <unk> of <unk> figures metric measurement of volume or pie and bar <unk> for example are only a small part of the total <unk> <unk> mr. <unk> says the preparation <unk> would n't <unk> too many if their real intent was general instruction or even general <unk> with test procedures 
 but learning materials matched on N of N <unk> 
 scoring high matched on N 
 in cat sections where students ' knowledge of <unk> <unk> sounds is tested the authors noted that scoring high concentrated on the same sounds that the test does to the exclusion of other sounds that fifth <unk> should know 
 learning materials for the <unk> contains at least a dozen examples of exact matches or close parallels to test items 
 rick <unk> senior editor of scoring high says that messrs. <unk> and <unk> are ignoring the need students have for becoming familiar with tests and testing format 
 he said authors of scoring high <unk> avoid <unk> exact questions but he does n't deny that some items are similar 
 when scoring high first came out in N it was a publication of random house 
 mcgraw-hill was <unk> 
 in a N advisory to educators mcgraw-hill said scoring high should n't be used because it represented a parallel form of the cat and <unk> tests 
 but in N mcgraw-hill purchased the random house unit that publishes scoring high which later became part of <unk> 
 messrs. <unk> and kean say they are <unk> of any efforts by mcgraw-hill to modify or <unk> scoring high 
 <unk> corp. said it completed the acquisition of sacramento savings & loan association from the <unk> & <unk> c. <unk> foundation for $ N million

 the department of health and human services plans to extend its <unk> on federal funding of research involving fetal-tissue transplants 
 medical researchers believe the <unk> of small amounts of <unk> tissue into humans could help treat <unk> <unk> and such <unk> diseases as <unk> 's <unk> 's and <unk> 's 
 but anti-abortionists oppose such research because they worry that the development of <unk> using fetal-tissue transplants could lead to an increase in abortions 
 james mason assistant secretary for health said the ban on federal funding of fetal-tissue transplant research should be continued indefinitely 
 he said the ban wo n't stop privately funded <unk> research or federally funded fetal-tissue research that does n't involve transplants 
 department officials say that hhs secretary louis sullivan will support dr. mason 's ruling which will be issued soon in the form of a letter to the acting director of the national institutes of health 
 both dr. mason and dr. sullivan oppose federal funding for abortion as does president bush except in cases where a woman 's life is threatened 
 the controversy began in N when the national institutes of health aware of the policy implications of its research asked for an hhs review of its plan to <unk> <unk> tissue into the brain of a patient suffering from <unk> 's disease 
 the department placed a <unk> on the research pending a review of scientific legal and ethical issues 
 a majority of an <unk> panel recommended late last year that the research continue under carefully controlled conditions but the issue became <unk> in politics as anti-abortion groups continued to oppose federal funding 
 the dispute has hampered the administration 's efforts to recruit prominent doctors to fill prestigious posts at the helm of the nih and the centers for disease control 
 several candidates have withdrawn their names from consideration after administration officials asked them for their views on abortion and fetal-tissue transplants 
 antonio novello whom mr. bush <unk> to serve as surgeon general reportedly has assured the administration that she opposes abortion 
 dr. novello is deputy director of the national institute of child health and human development 
 some researchers have charged that the administration is imposing new ideological tests for top scientific posts 
 earlier this week dr. sullivan tried to <unk> these charges by stressing that candidates to head the nih and the <unk> will be <unk> by standards of scientific and administrative <unk> not politics 
 but the administration 's handling of the fetal-tissue transplant issue <unk> many scientists 
 when scientific progress moves into <unk> ground there has to be a role for society to make judgments about its applications says <unk> <unk> associate dean of the yale medical school 
 the disturbing thing about this abortion issue is that the debate has become <unk> so that no mechanism exists for finding a middle ground 
 yale is one of the few medical institutions conducting privately funded research on fetal-tissue transplants 
 but dr. <unk> warns that dr. mason 's ruling may discourage private funding 
 the <unk> of federal funds and the climate in which the decision was made certainly do n't provide any incentive for one of the more visible foundations to provide support he said 
 despite the <unk> over transplants federal funding of research involving <unk> <unk> will continue on a number of fronts 
 such research may ultimately result in the ability to <unk> damaged <unk> or to turn off genes that cause cancer or to regulate genes that cause down 's syndrome the leading cause of mental <unk> according to an nih summary 
 the nih currently spends about $ N million annually on fetal-tissue research out of a total research budget of $ N billion

 the internal revenue service has threatened criminal sanctions against lawyers who fail to report detailed information about clients who pay them more than $ N in cash 
 the warnings issued to at least N criminal defense attorneys in several major cities in the last week have led to an outcry by members of the organized bar who claim the information is protected by <unk> privilege 
 the irs warnings stem from a N law that requires anyone who receives more than $ N in cash from a client or customer in one or more related transactions in the course of trade or business to report the payment on a document known as form N 
 the form asks for such details as the client 's name social security number <unk> number and details about the services provided for the payment 
 failure to complete the form had been punishable as a <unk> until last november when congress determined that the crime was a felony punishable by up to N years in prison 
 attorneys have argued since N when the law took effect that they can not provide information about clients who do n't wish their <unk> to be known 
 many attorneys have returned incomplete forms to the irs in recent years citing <unk> privilege 
 until last week the irs rarely acted on the incomplete forms 
 this form forces a lawyer to become in effect a witness against his client said neal r. <unk> president of the national association of criminal defense lawyers 
 the irs is asking lawyers to <unk> a criminal problem to the government added mr. <unk> a miami lawyer who has heard from dozens of attorneys who received letters in recent days and has himself received the <unk> irs forms sent by certified mail 
 mr. <unk> said that clients who pay cash may include alleged drug dealers who do n't have domestic bank accounts 
 these individuals may not necessarily be under investigation when they hire lawyers 
 mr. <unk> said there also may be other circumstances under which individuals would n't want the government to know they had retained criminal defense lawyers 
 filling out detailed forms about these individuals would tip the irs off and spark action against the clients he said 
 the defense lawyers ' group formed a task force this week <unk> by new york attorney gerald <unk> to deal with the matter 
 the american bar association 's house of delegates passed a resolution in N <unk> the irs reporting requirement 
 michael ross a new york lawyer who heads the aba 's grand jury committee said that lawyers are prohibited by the aba 's code of ethics from disclosing information about a client except where a court orders it or to prevent the client from committing a criminal act that could result in death 
 mr. ross said he met with officials of the irs and the justice department which would bring any enforcement actions against taxpayers to discuss the issue last may 
 at that meeting he said the justice department assured him that enforcement procedures would n't be threatened against attorneys without further review and advance notice 
 mr. ross said irs officials opposed the justice department 's moderate stance on the matter 
 but in the letters sent in recent days christopher j. <unk> of the irs computing center in detroit told attorneys that failing to voluntarily submit the requested information could result in <unk> enforcement action being initiated 
 in some cases the irs asked for information dating back to forms it received in N 
 a spokesman for the irs confirmed that there has been <unk> <unk> about incomplete <unk> but he declined to say why the letters were sent to lawyers now 
 individuals familiar with the justice department 's policy said that justice officials had n't any knowledge of the irs 's actions in the last week 
 lawyers worry that if they provide information about clients that data could quickly end up in the hands of prosecutors 
 prosecutors need court permission to obtain the tax returns of an individual or a business 
 but they have obtained N forms without court permission and used the information to help develop criminal cases 
 some criminal lawyers speculated that the irs was sending the letters to test the issue 
 in a number of recent cases federal courts have refused to recognize attorneys ' <unk> that information relating to fees from clients should be confidential

 fujitsu ltd. 's top executive took the unusual step of publicly <unk> for his company 's making bids of just one yen for several local government projects while computer rival nec corp. made a written <unk> for <unk> in the same practice 
 meanwhile business and government leaders <unk> the computer makers and <unk> about the broader statement the companies ' actions make about japanese <unk> pricing 
 fujitsu said it bid the equivalent of less than a u.s. penny on three separate municipal contracts during the past two years 
 the company also disclosed that during that period it offered N yen or about $ N for another contract 
 but fujitsu japan 's no. N computer maker is n't alone 
 nec one of its largest domestic competitors said it bid one yen in two separate public auctions since N 
 in both cases nec lost the contract to fujitsu which made the same bid and won a <unk> <unk> 
 all the contracts were for <unk> contracts and involved no hardware or software

 the bids he added were contrary to common sense 
 nec released a statement saying we feel sorry for having caused trouble to society a form of <unk> common in japan for companies caught in embarrassing situations 
 japanese companies have long had a reputation for <unk> short-term profits to make a sale that may have long-term benefits 
 but the growing controversy comes as many practices historically accepted as normal here such as politicians accepting substantial gifts from businessmen or having <unk> affairs are coming under close ethical scrutiny 
 the fire is also fueled by growing international interest in japanese behavior 
 so far there have been no public overseas complaints about the issue 
 but in one of the auctions in question international business machines corp. made a bid substantially higher than the fujitsu offer according to the <unk> 
 the <unk> bids touch on issues central to the increasingly <unk> trade debate 
 foreigners complain that they have limited access to government procurement in japan in part because japanese companies unfairly undercut them 
 the u.s. government in recent years has accused japanese companies of <unk> slashing prices on semiconductors and <unk> products fujitsu and nec make 
 asked whether the bidding <unk> would hurt <unk> relations mr. <unk> said this will be a minus factor 
 the <unk> controversy first came to a head last week when the city of hiroshima announced that fujitsu won a contract to design a computer system to <unk> its waterworks 
 the city had expected to pay about N million yen $ N but fujitsu essentially offered to do it for free 
 then wednesday fujitsu said it made a similar bid to win a library contract in <unk> <unk> two weeks earlier

 in september the <unk> maker said excess capacity and lagging billings would result in an estimated $ N million to $ N million net loss for the third quarter 
 but company officials said yesterday that they decided to take a $ N million pretax charge for the period to cover a restructuring of world-wide manufacturing operations citing extended weakness in the market as well as a decision to switch to more <unk> production techniques 
 over the summer months there has been a slowing in the rate of new orders from the computer sector our primary market said wilfred j. <unk> chairman and chief executive officer 
 in addition recent industry forecasts for N indicate a slow environment at least until midyear 
 as a result the company said it decided to phase out its oldest capacity and make appropriate reductions in operating expenses 
 the $ N million net loss <unk> N cents a share 
 not counting the extraordinary charge the company said it would have had a net loss of $ N million or seven cents a share 
 a year earlier it had profit of $ N million or N cents a share 
 revenue rose N N to $ N million from $ N million 
 the charge partly reflects a switch from older <unk> to <unk> <unk> silicon <unk> with which to <unk> chips 
 related to that decision the company said it was converting its santa clara calif. factory to a research and development facility 
 a spokesman declined to speculate about possible reductions in force

 the dollar posted gains against all major currencies yesterday buoyed by persistent japanese demand for u.s. bond issues 
 while market sentiment remains cautiously bearish on the dollar based on sluggish u.s. economic indicators dealers note that japanese demand has helped <unk> the dollar against the yen and has kept the u.s. currency from plunging below key levels against the mark 
 at the same time dealers said the u.s. unit has been locked into a relatively narrow range in recent weeks in part because the hefty japanese demand for dollars has been offset by the mark 's strength resulting in a <unk> 
 jay <unk> with capital insight inc. reasons that while the mark has posted significant gains against the yen as well the mark climbed to N yen from N yen late tuesday in new york the strength of the u.s. bond market compared to its foreign counterparts has helped lure investors to dollar-denominated bonds rather than mark bonds

 he cites the recent deal between the mitsubishi estate co. and the rockefeller group as well as the possible white knight role of an undisclosed japanese company in the georgia-pacific corp. takeover bid for great northern nekoosa corp. as evidence 
 the <unk> maturity in november of a 10-year japanese government <unk> bond issue valued at about $ N billion has prompted speculation in the market that investors <unk> the bonds will diversify into dollar-denominated instruments according to mr. madison 
 it remains unclear whether the bond issue will be rolled over

 sea containers ltd. said it might increase the price of its $ <unk> buy-back plan if pressed by temple holdings ltd. which made an earlier tender offer for sea containers 
 sea containers a hamilton <unk> shipping concern said tuesday that it would sell $ N billion of assets and use some of the proceeds to buy about N N of its common shares for $ N apiece 
 the move is designed to ward off a hostile takeover attempt by two european shipping concerns <unk> holding ag and <unk> plc 
 in may the two companies through their jointly owned holding company temple offered $ N a share or $ N million for sea containers 
 in august temple sweetened the offer to $ N a share or $ N million 
 yesterday sea containers ' chief executive officer james <unk> said in an interview that under the <unk> plan sea containers would end up with a cash surplus of approximately $ N million 
 about $ N million of that would be allocated to the buy-back leaving about $ N million he said 
 that $ N million mr. <unk> said gives us some flexibility in case temple raises its bid 
 we are able to increase our price above the $ N level if necessary 
 he declined to say however how much sea containers might raise its price 
 mr. <unk> speculated that the <unk> that sea containers has means that temple would have to substantially increase their bid if they 're going to top us 
 temple however <unk> criticized sea containers ' plan yesterday <unk> it as a highly conditional device designed to <unk> management <unk> shareholders and prevent them from accepting our superior cash offer 
 a spokesman for temple estimated that sea containers ' plan if all the asset sales <unk> would result in shareholders receiving only $ N to $ N a share in cash 
 the lower figures the spokesman said would stem from preferred shares being converted to common stock and the possibility that sea containers ' subsidiaries might be required to place their shares in the open market 
 temple added that sea containers is still mired in legal problems in <unk> where the supreme court has temporarily barred sea containers from buying back its own stock in a case brought by <unk> and <unk>

 the department proposed requiring stronger <unk> for light trucks and minivans beginning with N models 
 it also issued a final rule requiring auto makers to <unk> light trucks and minivans with <unk> belts for rear seats beginning in the N model year 
 such belts already are required for the vehicles ' front seats 
 today 's action transportation secretary samuel skinner said represents another <unk> in the ongoing program to promote vehicle <unk> safety in light trucks and minivans through its extension of passenger car standards 
 in september the department had said it will require trucks and minivans to be equipped with the same <unk> <unk> that have long been required on passenger cars 
 the big three auto makers said the rule changes were n't surprising because bush administration officials have long said they planned to impose car safety standards on light trucks and vans 
 safety advocates including some members of congress have been urging the department for years to extend <unk> requirements to light trucks and vans which now account for almost one-third of all vehicle sales in the u.s. 
 they say that many vehicles <unk> as commercial light trucks actually carry more people than cargo and therefore should have the same safety features as cars

 we 're in a very different regulatory environment 
 sen. john <unk> r. <unk> praised the department 's actions noting that <unk> crashes account for almost half of all <unk> deaths 
 we could prevent many of these <unk> with minimum <unk> standards he said 
 sen. <unk> and others also want the department to require additional safety equipment in light trucks and minivans including air bags or automatic seat belts in front seats and improved <unk> protection

 the <unk> would be required to withstand a force of N times the <unk> weight of the vehicle

 it is in my <unk> the best wine <unk> 's leap has produced and with fewer than N cases available it is sure to sell quickly 
 the price is a new high for california cabernet <unk> but it is not the highest 
 diamond creek N lake <unk> cabernet weighed in this fall with a <unk> price of $ N a bottle 
 one of the fastest growing segments of the wine market is the category of <unk> wines limited in production of <unk> quality or so perceived at any rate and with <unk> high prices 
 for years this group included a stable of <unk> <unk> first <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> grand <unk> <unk> <unk> and la <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> sweet wines <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> from germany and <unk> <unk> <unk> from <unk> 
 these first magnitude wines ranged in price from $ N to $ N a bottle 
 in the last year or so however this exclusive club has taken in a host of flashy new members 
 the <unk> have <unk> in price to meet the competition and it almost seems that there 's a race on to come up with the <unk> single bottle among current releases from every major wine region on the globe 
 france can <unk> the lion 's share of high-priced bottles 
 <unk> 's first <unk> from N and N are $ N to $ N each except for the smallest in terms of production <unk> <unk> which costs around $ N 
 these prices seem rather modest however in light of other french wines from current <unk> 
 <unk> <unk> the leading <unk> now goes for well over $ N a bottle for a lighter vintage like N the <unk> rich N runs $ N 
 in champagne some of the prestige <unk> are <unk> toward $ N a bottle

 the <unk> salon is $ N

 e. <unk> 's N <unk> <unk> la <unk> for example is $ N 
 none of france 's wine regions can steal a march on <unk> however

 there are certain <unk> wines that can command these higher prices says larry shapiro of <unk> 's one of the largest wine shops in dallas 
 what 's different is that it is happening with young wines just coming out 
 we 're seeing it partly because older <unk> are growing more scarce 
 wine auctions have almost exhausted the limited supply of those wines mr. shapiro continued we 've seen a dramatic decrease in demand for wines from the <unk> and <unk> which go for $ N to $ N a bottle 
 some of the newer wines even at $ N to $ N a bottle or so almost offer a bargain 
 take lake <unk> cabernet from diamond creek 
 it 's made only in years when the <unk> <unk> perfectly the last was N and comes from a single <unk> of <unk> that yielded a mere N cases in N 
 owner al <unk> originally planned to sell it for $ N a bottle but when a retailer in southern california asked is that wholesale or retail he <unk> the matter 
 offering the wine at roughly $ N a bottle wholesale $ N retail he sent merchants around the country a form asking them to check one of three answers N no the wine is too high N responses N yes it 's high but i 'll take it N responses N i 'll take all i can get N responses 
 the wine was shipped in <unk> cases instead of the usual N but even at that it was spread thin going to N retailers in N states 
 we thought it was <unk> expensive said sterling <unk> wine director at <unk> 's in <unk> ill. one of the top stores in suburban chicago but there are people out there with very different opinions of value 
 we got our two <unk> and they 're gone 
 mr. <unk> <unk> that he thinks <unk> prices have come about because producers do n't like to see a hit wine dramatically increase in price later on 
 even if there is consumer resistance at first a wine that wins high ratings from the critics will eventually move 
 there may be <unk> reaction initially said mr. <unk> but as the wine is talked about and starts to sell they eventually get excited and decide it 's worth the <unk> price to add it to their collection 
 it 's just sort of a <unk> thing with some people added larry shapiro 
 they like to talk about having the new red rock <unk> one of diamond creek 's <unk> or the dunn N cabernet or the <unk> 
 producers have seen this market opening up and they 're now creating wines that appeal to these people 
 that explains why the number of these wines is expanding so rapidly 
 but consumers who buy at this level are also more knowledgeable than they were a few years ago 
 they wo n't buy if the quality is not there said <unk> martin of martin wine <unk> in new orleans 
 or if they feel the wine is <unk> and they can get something equally good for less 
 mr. martin has increased prices on some wines like <unk> hills <unk> now $ N just to slow down movement but he is beginning to see some resistance to high-priced red <unk> and <unk> and <unk> in the $ N to $ N range 
 image has of course a great deal to do with what sells and what does n't and it ca n't be forced 
 wine merchants ca n't keep <unk> <unk> in stock but they have to push salon <unk> <unk> even lowering the price from $ N to $ N 
 it 's hardly a question of quality the N salon is a beautiful wine but as mr. <unk> noted people have their own ideas about value 
 it 's interesting to find that a lot of the expensive wines are n't always walking out the door 
 in every major market in the u.s. for instance you can buy <unk> la <unk> or <unk> virtually all of the first growth <unk> except <unk> as well as <unk> one and <unk> from california and at the moment the <unk> 's leap N <unk> N 
 with the biggest <unk> period of the year looming as the holidays approach it will be interesting to see how the <unk> fare

 the fed cut the key federal funds interest rate by about N percentage point to N N after the oct. N stock market plunge but has shown no sign of movement since

 retail sales also were reported slow in most districts particularly for discretionary <unk> items such as furniture home appliances and consumer electronics

 despite the economic slowdown there are few clear signs that growth is coming to a halt

 mr. black said he is pleased with the economy 's recent performance and does n't see a lot of excesses out there that would tilt us into recession 
 there is always a chance of recession added mr. <unk> but if you ask me to put a percentage on it i would think it 's well below a N N chance

 in september union <unk> corp. of memphis tenn. launched the edge account a package designed for the <unk> crowd with services that include a credit card and line of credit with no annual fees and a full percentage point off on installment loans 
 the theory such individuals many with young children are in their prime borrowing years and having borrowed from the bank they may continue to use it for other services in later years 
 for some time banks have been aiming packages at the elderly the <unk> segment with the highest savings 
 those efforts are being stepped up 
 <unk> macdonald vice president of retail sales at barnett banks inc. of <unk> fla. says the company now targets <unk> within the market by <unk> its popular seniors partners program to various life styles 
 <unk> age geography and <unk> differences create numerous <unk> ms. macdonald says 
 she says individual barnett branches can add different benefits to their seniors partners package such as athletic activities or travel clubs to appeal to local market interests 
 an active <unk> in <unk> <unk> may care more about senior olympic games while a <unk> in panama city may care more about a <unk> on health she says 
 banks have tried packaging before 
 in N wells fargo & co. of san francisco launched the gold account which included free checking a credit card <unk> box and travelers checks for a $ N monthly fee 
 the concept <unk> a slew of <unk> but the banks stopped promoting the packages 
 one big reason thin margins 
 many banks particularly smaller ones were slow to <unk> and could n't target market <unk> that would have made the programs more profitable 
 as banks ' earnings were squeezed in the mid-1970s the emphasis switched to finding ways to cut costs 
 but now computers are enabling more banks to analyze their customers by age income and geography 
 they are better able to get to those segments in the wake of the deregulation that began in the late 1970s 
 deregulation has effectively removed all restrictions on what banks can pay for deposits as well as opened up the field for new products such as <unk> cds 
 where a bank once offered a standard <unk> savings account it began offering money-market accounts certificates of deposit and <unk> checking and staggering rates based on the size of deposits 
 the competition has grown more intense as bigger banks such as <unk> corp. of minneapolis and chemical banking corp. of new york extend their market-share <unk> into small towns across the nation 
 today a banker is worrying about local regional and <unk> banks as well as thrifts and credit unions says ms. moore at <unk> research 
 so people who were n't even thinking about targeting N years ago are scrambling to define their customer base 
 the competition has <unk> a much <unk> consumer 
 the average household will spread N accounts over a dozen financial institutions says michael p. sullivan who runs his own bank consulting firm in charlotte n.c 
 this much <unk> makes attracting and keeping today 's <unk> customers costly 
 packages encourage loyalty by rewarding customers for doing the bulk of their banking in one place 
 for their troubles the banks get a larger <unk> audience that is less likely to move at the drop of a rate 
 the more accounts customers have mr. sullivan says the more likely they are to be attracted to a package and to be loyal to the bank that offers it 
 that can pay off down the road as customers especially the younger ones change from borrowers to <unk> 
 packaging has some <unk> 
 the additional technology personnel training and promotional effort can be expensive 
 chemical bank spent more than $ N million to introduce its <unk> line several packages aimed at different segments in N according to thomas jacob senior vice president of marketing 
 it 's not easy to roll out something that comprehensive and make it pay mr. jacob says 
 still bankers expect packaging to <unk> primarily because more customers are demanding that financial services be tailored to their needs 
 these days banking customers walk in the door expecting you to have a package especially for them ms. moore says 
 some banks are already moving in that direction according to alvin t. sale marketing director at first union corp. in charlotte 
 first union he says now has packages for seven customer groups 
 soon it will split those into N 
 says mr. sale i think more banks are starting to realize that we have to be more like the department store not the <unk> 
 iras 
 <unk> inc. said it will <unk> a registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission to <unk> a plan to sell N newly issued common shares 
 the chandler ariz. company said it will <unk> the registration to cover only the N million warrants each exercisable for the purchase of one common share 
 currently <unk> has about N million common shares outstanding 
 <unk> develops and markets low-cost software peripheral equipment and accessories for computers

 N make a lasting difference in the regulatory life of an american savings-and-loan association through the foster corporate parents plan 
 americans today spend $ N like <unk> change they do n't think much about it 
 but for an ailing savings-and-loan association <unk> on <unk> it can lead to safety from imminent demise and to a future full of promise 
 your $ N will help keep a <unk> savings and loan <unk> and out of the federal budget deficit 
 as a foster corporate parent you 'll be helping a neighborhood s&l in areas crucial to its survival 
 like healthy regulatory capital 
 a steady deposit base 
 performing loans 
 at the same time you 'll give your foster savings institution the gift of hope and freedom from the federal regulators who want to close its doors for good 
 as a foster corporate parent you will experience the same <unk> felt by robert bass lewis <unk> william simon and others who find ways to help troubled savings institutions and their employees help themselves 
 that builds confidence <unk> <unk> not to mention critical regulatory net worth 
 do n't wait a savings institution needs your help now 
 every day you delay a savings institution 's health and the federal budget deficit grows worse 
 think about the good you can do for just $ N a month about the cost of a <unk> chevrolet or two <unk> at a state university 
 then send your support to a savings institution that has taken a bad <unk> in the press and on its bottom line 
 every $ N you send will go a long way to boost sagging net worth and employee morale and keep your foster savings institution off the federal budget deficit 
 mr. <unk> is a lawyer in new york 
 the chicago mercantile exchange said it plans to institute an additional circuit breaker aimed at stemming market <unk> 
 separately john phelan told a closed house subcommittee meeting in washington that he would support securities and exchange commission halts of program trading during market <unk> 
 but the new york stock exchange chairman said he does n't support <unk> a collar on program trading arguing that firms could get around such a limit 
 the chicago merc said a new one-hour price limit would take effect in its standard & poor 's N stock-index futures pit once s&p N futures fell N index points the equivalent of about a <unk> drop in the dow jones industrial average 
 if the <unk> limit is triggered after N p.m chicago time it would remain in effect until the normal close of trading at N p.m 
 with the limit in effect members would be able to execute trades at the limit price or at higher prices but not below it 
 the exchange said it decided a new circuit breaker was needed following a review of the tumultuous trading in stocks and stock-index futures on friday oct. N when the dow jones industrials plunged N points and stock-index futures prices skidded as well 
 late that afternoon the s&p N stock-index futures contract fell a total of N index points hitting a merc circuit breaker limit that remained in effect for the rest of the trading session 
 the merc said that its existing <unk> <unk> limit on s&p N stock-index futures trading equal to about N points on the dow jones industrials which was triggered oct. N will remain in effect 
 leo <unk> merc executive committee chairman said that the <unk> limit appeared to <unk> the selling panic oct. N 
 but when the contract reopened the subsequent flood of sell orders that quickly knocked the contract down to the <unk> limit indicated that the intermediate limit of N points was needed to help keep stock and stock-index futures prices <unk> 
 several traders maintained that the merc 's <unk> <unk> <unk> the market slide oct. N by <unk> additional selling pressure to the floor of the new york stock exchange 
 all of the changes require regulatory approval which is expected shortly 
 the exchange also said that the <unk> circuit breaker which currently provides only a one-hour <unk> during market <unk> will become the maximum one-day limit for the s&p N stock-index futures contract the one-day limit now is N index points 
 a final <unk> was made to the <unk> opening limit for the contract 
 the merc said that <unk> limit will remain in effect for the first N minutes of trading 
 the limit <unk> under current exchange rules if contracts trade above the limit price during the opening N minutes of trading 
 in washington house aides said mr. phelan told congressmen that the collar which banned program trades through the big board 's computer when the dow jones industrial average moved N points did n't work well 
 he said that firms could get around the collar by executing trades <unk> 
 in a <unk> news conference mr. phelan who has publicly expressed concern about market volatility said he told the house finance and telecommunications subcommittee that he would support the program-trading halt proposal providing the sec would be comfortable with the language in a bill 
 the program-trading issue is heating up on capitol hill as it is on wall street and several legislators want to grant the sec the power to shut off the programs when trading becomes too volatile 
 sec chairman richard breeden has said he would be willing to consider circuit breakers that have <unk> trigger points but he does n't want discretionary power to stop programs 
 a house aide suggested that mr. phelan was so vague and <unk> that it was the kind of meeting where people of all <unk> could come out feeling good 
 at one point mr. phelan angered the subcommittee 's chairman rep. edward markey d. mass. by not going much beyond what already had been reported in the morning newspapers 
 markey said we could have done this in public because so little sensitive information was disclosed the aide said 
 mr. phelan then responded that he would have been happy just writing a report to the panel the aide added 
 at another point during the hearing rep. markey asked mr. phelan what would be discussed at a new york exchange board meeting today 
 mr. phelan said the big board is likely to study the program-trading issue 
 that response <unk> rep. markey house aides said and the congressman snapped back that there had been enough studies of the issue and that it was time for action on the matter 
 <unk> of the N subcommittee members attended the hearing most notably rep. john dingell d. mich. the full house energy and commerce committee chairman who has been willing to let mr. markey carry the legislation in recent months 
 mr. dingell expressed concern sources said about <unk> problems in <unk> program trading which uses futures to offset stock trades 
 the futures industry is regulated by the commodity futures trading commission which reports to the agriculture committees in both houses 
 the art of <unk> is <unk> to the english and like most english <unk> <unk> to the rest of the world 
 <unk> l. <unk> the nine <unk> 
 <unk> england 
 of all scenes that <unk> rural england this is one of the <unk> an ancient stone church stands amid the fields the sound of bells <unk> from its tower calling the <unk> to <unk> 
 the <unk> of st. michael and all angels stop to <unk> at the church door as members here always have 
 in the tower five men and women pull <unk> on ropes attached to the same five bells that first sounded here in N 
 but there is also a <unk> modern note in <unk> though it ca n't be heard by the <unk> enjoying the <unk> of bells this cool autumn evening 
 like most of the other N <unk> in britain with sets of bells st. michael once had its own band of ringers who would herald every sunday morning and evening service 
 now only one local ringer remains <unk> <unk> hammond 
 the others here today live elsewhere 
 they belong to a group of N ringers including two <unk> and four youngsters in training who drive every sunday from church to church in a <unk> effort to keep the bells <unk> in the many <unk> of east <unk> 
 to ring for even one service at this tower we have to <unk> says mr. hammond a retired <unk> worker 
 we 've tried to train the youngsters but they have their <unk> and their <unk> and they just <unk> away 
 mr. hammond worries that old age and the <unk> of youth will <unk> the ranks of the east <unk> group that keeps the <unk> bells <unk> 
 history after all is not on his side 
 according to a nationwide survey taken a year ago nearly a third of england 's church bells are no longer <unk> on <unk> because there is no one to ring them 
 it is easy to see why the ancient art is on the ropes 
 the less complicated version of playing <unk> on bells as do the <unk> of continental europe is considered by the english to be <unk> fit only for foreigners 
 <unk> a <unk> exercise the english invented N years ago requires physical <unk> some bells weigh more than a ton combined with intense mental concentration 
 proper english bells are started off in <unk> from the <unk> bell to the lowest a simple <unk> scale using in larger <unk> as many as N bells 
 then at a signal the ringers begin <unk> the order in which the bells sound without <unk> the steady <unk> of the striking 
 each <unk> or change can occur only once the rules state 
 ringers <unk> patterns of changes known as methods which have <unk> names like kent <unk> bob major or <unk> <unk> 
 a series of N or so changes is a <unk> and takes about three hours 
 a look at a thursday night practice at st. mary <unk> church in the <unk> district of london gives an idea of the work involved 
 ten <unk> ringers stand in a circle one foot ahead of the other in a <unk> 's stance each pulling a <unk> that disappears through a small hole in the high ceiling of the ringing chamber 
 no one speaks and the <unk> of the ropes seems to make as much sound as the bells themselves <unk> by the ceiling 
 totally absorbed the ringers <unk> straight ahead using peripheral vision they call it <unk> to watch the other ropes and thus time their pulls 
 far above in the <unk> the huge <unk> bells mounted on wheels swing <unk> through a full N degrees starting and ending surprisingly in the <unk> or <unk> position 
 skilled ringers use their <unk> to advance or <unk> the next swing so that one bell can swap places with another in the following change 
 in a well-known <unk> involving church bells english novelist <unk> l. <unk> described ringing as a passion that finds its satisfaction in <unk> <unk> and mechanical <unk> 
 ringers she added are filled with the <unk> <unk> that comes of <unk> <unk> <unk> performed 
 ringing does become a bit of an <unk> admits <unk> <unk> master of the band at st. mary <unk> and one of england 's best female ringers 
 it is a passion that usually stays in the tower however 
 more often than not ringers think of the church as something stuck on the bottom of the <unk> 
 when their changes are completed and after they have worked up a sweat ringers often <unk> off to the local <unk> leaving <unk> for others below 
 this does not sit well with some <unk> 
 with membership of the church of england steadily <unk> <unk> <unk> are pressing equally <unk> and often <unk> ringers to attend services 
 two years ago the rev. <unk> <unk> vicar of great <unk> <unk> got so fed up with ringers who did n't attend service he <unk> the entire band the ringers promptly set up a picket line in protest 
 they were a <unk> club that treated the tower as sort of a separate premises the vicar <unk> says 
 an entirely new band <unk> today at great <unk> several of whom are members of the <unk> 
 but there still are n't enough ringers to ring more than six of the eight bells 
 at st. mary 's church in <unk> <unk> the bells have fallen silent following a <unk> over church attendance 
 the vicar <unk> jones refuses to talk about it saying it would reopen the wound 
 but <unk> marshall vicar of a nearby church feels the fault is in the <unk> from the bell tower that are located next to the <unk> 
 so crunch crunch crunch bang bang bang here come the ringers from above making a very obvious exit while the <unk> is at <unk> he says 
 vicar marshall admits to mixed feelings about this issue since he is both a vicar and an active <unk> himself 
 the sound of bells is a net to draw people into the church he says 
 i live in hopes that the ringers themselves will be drawn into that <unk> life 
 the central council of church bell ringers a sort of parliament of ringing groups aims to improve relations with <unk> says john c. baldwin president 
 it hopes to speak to students at <unk> colleges about the <unk> of bell ringing and will shortly publish a <unk> for every vicar in the country entitled the bells in your care 
 says mr. baldwin we recognize that we may no longer have as high a priority in church life and experience 
 mr. baldwin is also attacking the greater problem lack of ringers 
 one survey says that of the N trained <unk> in england today only N of them still ring 
 also ringers do n't always live where the bells need to be <unk> like in small rural <unk> and inner-city <unk> 
 but the council 's program to attract and train ringers is only partly successful says mr. baldwin 
 right now we 're lucky if after five years we keep one new ringer out of N he adds 
 one bright sign is that a growing number of women have entered the once <unk> field more than a third of the ringers today are women 
 they are n't accepted everywhere however 
 the oldest <unk> group in the country the ancient society of college <unk> founded in N remains <unk> a fact that 's particularly <unk> to women because the group is the sole source of ringers for britain 's most prestigious <unk> st. paul 's <unk> and <unk> <unk> 
 this being britain no woman has filed an <unk> suit but the extent of the problem surfaced this summer in a series of letters to the ringing world a weekly newspaper for ringers 
 one writer signing his letter as <unk> balanced male <unk> on the frequency of women <unk> in <unk> and suggested that they settle back into their traditional role of making tea at meetings 
 in the <unk> of replies that followed one woman ringer from <unk> observed that the average male ringer leaves quite a lot to be <unk> badly dressed <unk> with <unk> and a large <unk> frequently <unk> and <unk> <unk> in <unk> 
 another women wrote from <unk> to say that in her N years of ringing i have never known a lady to <unk> in the <unk> 
 i have seen one or two men die <unk> them 
 investors unsettled by the stock market 's gyrations can take some comfort in the predictable <unk> of quarterly dividend checks 
 that has been particularly true this year with many companies raising their payouts more than N N 
 but do n't <unk> too easy those dividend increases may signal trouble ahead for stock prices some analysts warn 
 in the past they say the strongest dividend growth has often come at times when the stock-market party was almost over 
 that can be a trap for <unk> investors says richard bernstein senior <unk> analyst at merrill lynch & co 
 strong dividend growth he says is the black widow of valuation a reference to the female <unk> that attract males and then kill them after <unk> 
 stephen boesel president of t. rowe price growth and income fund explains that companies raise their payouts most <unk> only after the economy and corporate profits have been growing for some time 
 invariably those strong periods in the economy give way to <unk> environments he says 
 and <unk> environments are n't <unk> to the stock market 
 indeed analysts say that payouts have sometimes risen most sharply when prices were already on their way down from cyclical <unk> 
 in N for example dividends on the stocks in standard & poor 's 500-stock index soared N N following much slower growth the year before 
 the s&p index started sliding in price in september N and fell N N in N despite a N N expansion in dividends that year 
 that pattern has n't always held but recent strong growth in dividends makes some market watchers anxious 
 payouts on the s&p N stocks rose N N in N according to standard & poor 's corp. and wall street estimates for N growth are generally between N N and N N 
 many people believe the growth in dividends will slow next year although a minority see double-digit gains continuing 
 meanwhile many market watchers say recent dividend trends raise another warning flag while dividends have risen <unk> their expansion has n't kept pace with even stronger advances in stock prices 
 as a result the market 's dividend yield dividends as a percentage of price has slid to a level that is fairly low and <unk> by historical standards 
 put another way the decline in the yield suggests stocks have gotten pretty rich in price relative to the dividends they pay some market analysts say 
 they are keeping a close watch on the yield on the s&p N 
 the figure is currently about N N up from N N before the recent market slide 
 some analysts say investors should run for the <unk> if a sustained market rebound <unk> the yield below N N 
 a drop below that N N benchmark has always been a strong warning sign that stocks are fully valued says mr. boesel of t. rowe price 
 in fact the market has always <unk> 
 always 
 there 's never been an exception says gerald w. <unk> a chicago investment adviser and money manager based on a review of six decades of stock-market data 
 the last time the s&p N yield dropped below N N was in the summer of N 
 stockholders who took the hint and sold shares escaped the october debacle 
 there have been only seven other times in N N N N N N and N when the yield on the s&p N dropped below N N for at least two consecutive months mr. <unk> found 
 and in each case he says a sharp drop in stock prices began within a year 
 still some market analysts say the current N N reading is n't as troublesome as it might have been in years past 
 it 's not a very meaningful indicator currently because corporations are not <unk> in a traditional manner says james h. <unk> head of stock investments for cigna corp. the <unk> insurer 
 in particular mr. <unk> says businesses are paying out a smaller percentage of their profits and cash flow in the form of dividends than they have historically 
 so while stock prices may look fairly high relative to dividends they are not excessive relative to the underlying corporate strength 
 rather than increasing dividends some companies have used cash to buy back some of their shares notes steven g. einhorn <unk> of the investment policy committee at goldman sachs & co 
 he factors that into the market yield to get an adjusted yield of about N N 
 that is just a <unk> below the average of the past N years or so he says 
 what will happen to dividend growth next year 
 common wisdom suggests a <unk> rate of growth reflecting a weakening in the economy and corporate profits 
 painewebber inc. for instance is forecasting growth in s&p N dividends of just under N N in N down from an estimated N N this year 
 in other years in which there have been moderate economic <unk> the environment the firm expects in N the change in dividends ranged from a gain of N N to a decline of N N according to painewebber analyst thomas <unk> 
 the minority argument meanwhile is that businesses have the financial <unk> this time around to declare sharply higher dividends even if their earnings weaken 
 dividend growth on the order of N N is expected by both mr. <unk> of cigna and mr. einhorn of goldman sachs 
 those dividend bulls argue that corporations are in the unusual position of having plenty of cash left over after paying dividends and making capital expenditures 
 one indicator investors might want to watch is the monthly tally from standard & poor 's of the number of public companies adjusting their dividends 
 a total of N companies raised dividends in october basically unchanged from N a year ago s&p said wednesday 
 that followed four straight months in which the number of increases trailed the year-earlier pace 
 while the s&p tally does n't measure the magnitude of dividend changes a further <unk> in the number of dividend increases could be a <unk> of slower dividend growth next year 
 in any case opinion is mixed on how much of a boost the overall stock market would get even if dividend growth continues at double-digit levels 
 mr. einhorn of goldman sachs estimates the stock market will deliver a N N to N N total return from appreciation and dividends over the next N months vs. a cash rate of return of perhaps N N or N N if dividend growth is weak 
 but mr. boesel of t. rowe price who also expects N N growth in dividends next year does n't think it will help the overall market all that much 
 having the dividend increases is a supportive element in the market outlook but i do n't think it 's a main consideration he says 
 with slower economic growth and flat corporate earnings likely next year i would n't look for the market to have much upside from current levels

 mr. nixon the most prominent american to come to china since beijing 's bloody <unk> of pro-democracy demonstrators in june <unk> on international <unk> over the massacre 
 the chinese in turn took aim at american <unk> in china 's domestic affairs 
 one official newspaper legal daily even directly criticized mr. nixon who is normally referred to here as an old friend 
 the paper accused him of being a leading <unk> of peaceful evolution a catch phrase to describe what china believes is the policy of western countries to <unk> socialist nations into the capitalist <unk> 
 the tension was evident on wednesday evening during mr. nixon 's final <unk> <unk> normally an opportunity for <unk> <unk> about <unk> friendship 
 instead mr. nixon reminded his host chinese president <unk> <unk> that americans have n't <unk> china 's leaders for the military assault of june N that killed hundreds and perhaps thousands of demonstrators 
 many in the united states including many friends of china believe the crackdown was excessive and <unk> mr. nixon told mr. <unk> who was directly involved in ordering the attack 
 the events of april through june damaged the respect and confidence which most americans previously had for the leaders of china 
 the chinese responded in an equally <unk> fashion 
 in talks with mr. nixon chinese leaders expressed no regret for the killings and even suggested that the u.s. was <unk> involved in the demonstrations this spring 
 in a meeting tuesday supreme leader deng <unk> told mr. nixon frankly speaking the u.s. was involved too deeply in the turmoil and <unk> <unk> which occurred in beijing not long ago 
 china was the real victim and it is <unk> to <unk> china for it 
 despite the harsh exchanges the u.s. and china still seem to be looking for a way to <unk> relations which have deteriorated into what mr. nixon referred to as the greatest crisis in <unk> relations since his initial visit to china N years ago

 according to an american member of the nixon party the former president raised a number of controversial issues in his N hours of talks with <unk> chinese officials 
 these included china 's economic policies human rights and the question of mr. <unk> 
 mr. nixon also proposed that china restore its participation in the <unk> program a u.s. <unk> academic exchange 
 china pulled out of the program in july 
 in his talks the former president urged china 's leaders to acknowledge that their nation is part of the world community and welcome the <unk> of outside contacts and ideas 
 ideas are going over borders and there 's no sdi ideological weapon that can shoot them down he told a group of americans at the u.s. embassy on wednesday 
 there are no signs however of china 's yielding on key issues 
 but in one minor matter mr. nixon appears to have gained a <unk> 
 in a meeting with premier <unk> <unk> on monday mr. nixon said that he hoped he would n't <unk> guards with machine guns during his visit to the u.s. embassy 
 sure enough when he arrived at the embassy two days later the <unk> guards were gone for the first time in five months 
 a few blocks away at the u.s. ambassador 's residence the guards <unk> the compound also had discarded their <unk> arms for the first time since early june

 program traders are <unk> of predicting that if they are blocked in the u.s. they will simply <unk> to foreign stock markets 
 but in london and tokyo where computer-driven trading now plays a small but growing role traders say a number of hurdles <unk> 
 government officials especially in japan probably would resist any <unk> of program trading by players trying to <unk> off the u.s. furor over their activities and <unk> abroad with their business 
 japan is very concerned about the possible effects of program trading a senior japanese official said after the oct. N stock plunge in new york 
 u.s. stock-index futures are n't even traded in japan now 
 and because of the time difference the japanese and the u.s. markets ' trading hours do n't <unk> 
 it all adds up to a barrier to <unk> index arbitrage the most popular form of u.s. program trading that seeks to exploit brief differences between prices of stocks in new york and the price of a futures contract in chicago based on those stocks 
 about N N of all program trading by new york stock exchange firms in september took place in foreign markets according to big board data 
 yet it is difficult to imagine japan racing to introduce <unk> stock-index futures 
 japan 's finance ministry already is <unk> institutional investors ' activity to see whether policy changes are needed to cope with the current level of program trading said <unk> utsumi vice minister for international finance 
 program trading has taken off in japan since last year 's introduction of <unk> stock-index futures trading on the tokyo and osaka stock exchanges 
 but regulators are wary 
 they have n't forgotten the leap in share prices last dec. N when the first <unk> of <unk> index arbitrage drove stocks <unk> in the last half-hour of trading startling regulators who thought they had written enough rules to prevent such a swing 
 japan 's finance ministry had set up <unk> to limit how far futures prices could fall in a single session and to give market operators the authority to suspend trading in futures at any time 
 maybe it was n't enough a finance ministry official noted after the dec. N surge 
 japan 's regulators have since tightened controls on <unk> stock purchases 
 tokyo 's leading program traders are the big u.s. securities houses though the japanese are playing <unk> 
 some u.s. firms notably salomon inc. and morgan stanley group inc. have <unk> a hefty chunk of their japanese earnings from index arbitrage both for customers and for their own accounts 
 morgan stanley last week joined a growing list of u.s. securities firms that have stopped doing index arbitrage for their own accounts 
 both <unk> c. <unk> who heads salomon in tokyo and john s. <unk> who heads morgan stanley there <unk> a good part of their firms ' success in tokyo to their ability to offer sophisticated futures-related investment strategies to big institutional clients 
 they do n't have plans to cut back 
 it has not been <unk> in the markets here mr. <unk> said 
 the real difference seems to be that the cash market here is big enough and liquid enough that the futures market is n't having the same impact it does in america 
 the british also are <unk> program trades 
 index-arbitrage trading is something we want to watch closely an official at london 's stock exchange said 
 we do n't think there is cause for concern at the moment 
 london serves increasingly as a <unk> for program trading of u.s. stocks 
 market professionals said london has several <unk> 
 first the trading is done over the counter and is n't reported on either the u.s. or london stock trading tapes 
 second it can be used to <unk> positions before u.s. trading begins but at prices pegged to the previous session 's big board close 
 in addition to the extra privacy of these trades the transactions can often be less expensive to execute because the parties do n't have to pay a floor brokerage fee or a specialist 's fee 
 still much less index-arbitrage activity is done over here than in the u.s. said richard <unk> chief investment manager at standard life assurance co. which manages about # N billion $ N billion in united kingdom institutional funds 
 britain has two main index-arbitrage instruments 
 a financial times-stock exchange 100-share index option contract is traded on the london stock exchange 's traded options market 
 and an ft-se futures contract is traded on the london international financial futures exchange 
 both contracts have gained a following since the N global market crash 
 the average number of ft-se option contracts traded on the london exchange has surged nearly tenfold since the contract 's launch in N 
 this year the average of daily contracts traded totaled N up from N a year earlier and from N in N 
 but a survey early this summer indicated that the volume of <unk> trading was only N N of the size of the underlying equity market exchange officials said 
 this compares with estimates that the u.s. <unk> market is perhaps four times as large as the underlying domestic market 
 the house voted to boost the federal minimum wage for the first time since early N casting a solid N vote for a compromise measure backed by president bush 
 the vote came after a debate <unk> with complaints from both proponents and critics of a substantial increase in the wage floor 
 advocates said the <unk> rise to $ N an hour by april N is too small for the working poor while opponents argued that the increase will still hurt small business and cost many thousands of jobs 
 but the legislation reflected a compromise agreed to on tuesday by president bush and democratic leaders in congress after congressional republicans urged the white house to <unk> a bit from its previous resistance to compromise 
 so both sides accepted the compromise which would lead to the first lifting of the minimum wage since a four-year law was enacted in N raising the wage to $ N an hour from $ N 
 under the measure passed yesterday the minimum wage would rise to $ N next april 
 the senate plans to take up the measure quickly and is expected to pass it 
 there are no <unk> about this bill rep. pat williams d. <unk> said during house floor debate yesterday 
 but because it 's all we 've got i 'm going to vote for it 
 while the minimum wage had traditionally been pegged at half the average u.s. manufacturing wage the level of $ N an hour in N will still be less than N N of average factory pay mr. williams said 
 but rep. <unk> <unk> r. n.j instead praised the house 's acceptance of a new youth training wage a <unk> that gop <unk> have sought for many years 
 adopting a <unk> policy means getting beyond the nickel and <unk> of the minimum wage mrs. <unk> said 
 policy makers regard the youth wage as helping to limit the loss of jobs from an increase in the minimum wage but they have lately touted it as necessary to help <unk> job skills to <unk> into the work force 
 labor unions and democrats long fought the idea but recently <unk> to it in the face of bush administration insistence 
 the compromise sets the training wage at $ N an hour next april and at $ N an hour or N N of the minimum wage in april N 
 employers can pay the <unk> for N days without restriction to workers with less than six months of job experience and for another N days if the company uses a <unk> training program for the young workers 
 the training wage covers only workers who are N to N years old 
 the white house previously insisted on an <unk> six-month training wage that could be paid any time a worker of any age took a new job 
 the u.s. chamber of commerce still opposed to any <unk> increase said the compromise plan to lift the wage floor N N in two stages between april N and april N will be impossible for many employers to accommodate and will result in the elimination of jobs for american workers and higher prices for american consumers

 for six years t. marshall hahn jr. has made corporate acquisitions in the george bush mode kind and <unk> 
 the question now can he act more like <unk> teddy <unk> 
 mr. hahn the <unk> chairman and chief executive officer of georgia-pacific corp. is leading the <unk> concern 's unsolicited $ N billion bid for great northern nekoosa corp 
 nekoosa has given the offer a public cold shoulder a reaction mr. hahn has n't faced in his N earlier acquisitions all of which were negotiated behind the scenes 
 so far mr. hahn is trying to <unk> nekoosa into negotiating a friendly surrender while talking tough 
 we are prepared to pursue aggressively completion of this transaction he says 
 but a takeover battle opens up the possibility of a bidding war with all that implies 
 if a competitor enters the game for example mr. hahn could face the dilemma of paying a premium for nekoosa or seeing the company fall into the arms of a rival 
 given that choice associates of mr. hahn and industry observers say the former university president who has developed a reputation for not <unk> for anything would <unk> 
 there 's a price above which i 'm positive marshall has the <unk> not to pay says <unk> <unk> georgia-pacific 's executive vice president for pulp and paper 
 says <unk> associate jerry <unk> vice president corporate development at <unk> industries inc. he is n't of the old school of winning at any cost 
 he also is a consensus manager insiders say 
 the decision to make the bid for nekoosa for example was made only after all six members of georgia-pacific 's management committee signed onto the deal even though mr. hahn knew he wanted to go after the company early on says mr. <unk> 
 associates say mr. hahn picked up that careful approach to management as president of virginia <unk> institute 
 assuming that post at the age of N he managed by consensus as is the rule in universities says warren h. <unk> a university official who is <unk> a book on mr. hahn 
 but he also showed a willingness to take a strong stand 
 in N mr. hahn called in state police to arrest student protesters who were <unk> a university building 
 that impressed robert b. <unk> georgia-pacific 's chief executive at the time whom mr. hahn had met while <unk> for the institute 
 in N mr. <unk> <unk> mr. hahn into joining the company as executive vice president in charge of chemicals the move <unk> many in georgia-pacific who did n't believe a university administrator could make the transition to the corporate world 
 but mr. hahn rose swiftly through the ranks <unk> a raw intelligence that he says he knew he <unk> early on 
 the son of a <unk> mr. hahn <unk> first grade because his reading ability was so far above his <unk> 
 moving rapidly through school he <unk> <unk> beta <unk> from the university of kentucky at age N after spending only N N years in college 
 he earned his <unk> in nuclear physics from the massachusetts institute of technology 
 mr. hahn agrees that he has a <unk> memory but friends say that 's an <unk> 
 they call it photographic 
 mr. hahn also has engineered a surprising turnaround of georgia-pacific 
 taking over as chief executive officer in N he inherited a company that was mired in debt and hurt by a <unk> slide in its <unk> business 
 mr. hahn began selling <unk> businesses such as oil and gas and chemicals 
 he even sold one unit that made <unk> <unk> covers 
 at the same time he began building up the pulp and paper segment of the company while <unk> building products on home repair and remodeling rather than materials for new-home construction 
 the idea was to buffet building products from cycles in new-home construction 
 the formula has paid off so far 
 georgia-pacific 's sales climbed to $ N billion last year compared with $ N billion in N when mr. hahn took the reins 
 profit from continuing operations has soared to $ N million from $ N million 
 mr. hahn attributes the gains to the philosophy of concentrating on what a company knows best 
 the record of companies that have diversified is n't all that impressive he says 
 nekoosa would n't be a diversification 
 it would be a good match mr. hahn and many analysts say of two healthy companies with high-quality assets and strong cash flows 
 the resulting company would be the largest forest-products concern in the world with combined sales of more than $ N billion 
 but can mr. hahn carry it off 
 in this instance industry observers say he is entering <unk> waters 
 says <unk> <unk> an analyst at first manhattan co. this is the greatest acquisition challenge he has faced 
 a house-senate conference approved major portions of a package for more than $ N million in economic aid for poland that relies heavily on $ N million in credit and loan guarantees in fiscal N in hopes of <unk> future trade and investment 
 for the agency for international development <unk> approved $ N million in secondary loan guarantees under an expanded trade credit insurance program and total loan guarantees for the overseas private investment corp. are increased by $ N million over fiscal N as part of the same poland package 
 the conference approved at least $ N million in direct cash and development assistance as well and though no decision was made both sides are committed to adding more than $ N million in economic support funds and environmental initiatives sought by the bush administration 
 the agreement on poland contrasts with the major differences remaining over the underlying foreign aid bill which has already provoked veto threats by the white house and is sharply confined under this year 's budget 
 these fiscal pressures are also a factor in shaping the poland package and while more ambitious <unk> legislation is still pending the appropriations bill in conference will be more decisive on u.s. aid to eastern europe 
 to accommodate the additional cash assistance the house appropriations committee last week was required to <unk> an estimated $ N million from the pentagon 
 and though the size of the loan guarantees approved yesterday is significant recent experience with a similar program in central america indicates that it could take several years before the new polish government can fully use the aid effectively 
 the action on poland came as the conference separately approved $ N million for international population planning activities an N N increase over fiscal N 
 the house and senate are divided over whether the united nations population fund will receive any portion of these appropriations but the size of the increase is itself significant 
 in a second area of common concern the world environment an additional $ N million will be provided in development assistance to fund a series of initiatives related both to global warming and the plight of the african elephant 
 the sweeping nature of the bill draws a variety of special interest amendments running from an import exemption for a california <unk> museum to a small but intriguing struggle among sugar producing nations over the fate of panama 's quota of exports to the profitable u.s. market 
 panama was stripped of this right because of u.s. differences with the noriega regime but the central american country would have received a quota of N metric tons over a <unk> period ending sept. N N 
 about a quarter of this share has already been <unk> according to the industry but the remaining N tons are still a lucrative target for growers because the current u.s. price of N cents a pound runs as much as a nickel a pound above the world rate 
 the potential sales are nearly $ N million and house majority whip william gray d. pa began the bidding this year by proposing language that the quota be allocated to <unk> countries of the caribbean such as jamaica and <unk> 
 rep. jerry lewis a conservative <unk> added a provision of his own intended to assist <unk> and the senate then <unk> the list further by including all countries in the u.s. caribbean basin <unk> as well as the philippines backed by the powerful hawaii democrat sen. daniel inouye 
 jamaica wary of <unk> its caribbean basin allies has apparently instructed its lobbyist to abandon the provision initially drafted by mr. gray but the greater question is whether mr. inouye who has strong ties to the sugar industry is able to <unk> a claim by the philippines 
 in separate floor action the house <unk> budget restrictions and gave quick approval to $ N billion in supplemental appropriations for law enforcement and anti-drug programs in fiscal N 
 the funding is attached to an estimated $ N billion transportation bill that goes next to the senate and carries with it a proposed permanent smoking ban on virtually all u.s. domestic airline flights 
 the leadership hopes to move the compromise measure promptly to the white house but in recent days the senate has been as likely to bounce bills back to the house 
 the most recent example was a nearly $ N billion fiscal N bill funding the state justice and commerce departments 
 and after losing a battle tuesday night with the senate foreign relations committee <unk> from both houses are expected to be forced back to conference 
 beauty takes <unk> to safety on bridges

 a second <unk> covering the company 's <unk> pa. coke works involved more than N alleged violations of <unk> and other requirements for which osha proposed $ N million in fines 
 labor secretary elizabeth dole said the magnitude of these penalties and <unk> is matched only by the magnitude of the hazards to workers which resulted from corporate <unk> to worker safety and health and severe cutbacks in the maintenance and repair programs needed to remove those hazards 
 osha said there have been three worker <unk> at the two plants in the past two years and N deaths since N 
 gerard <unk> the head of osha said usx managers have known about many of the safety and health deficiencies at the plants for years yet have failed to take necessary action to <unk> the hazards

 once we do they will receive very serious evaluation the spokesman said 
 no consideration is more important than the health and safety of our employees 
 usx said it has been <unk> with osha since the agency began investigating the <unk> and <unk> works 
 he said that if and when safety problems were identified they were corrected 
 the usx <unk> represented the first sizable enforcement action taken by osha under mr. <unk> 
 he has promised <unk> fines though the size of penalties sought by osha have been rising in recent years even before he took office this year 
 the big problem is that usx management has proved unwilling to devote the necessary resources and manpower to removing hazards and to <unk> safety and health in the plants said linda <unk> osha regional administrator in philadelphia

 the house passed legislation designed to make it easier for the transportation department to block airline leveraged buy-outs

 the bush administration has threatened to veto such a bill because of what it views as an <unk> <unk> into the affairs of industry but the N vote suggests that supporters have the potential to override a veto 
 the broader question is where the senate stands on the issue 
 while the senate commerce committee has approved legislation similar to the house bill on airline leveraged buy-outs the measure has n't yet come to the full floor 
 although the legislation would apply to acquisitions involving any major airline it is aimed at giving the transportation department the chance to review in advance transactions financed by large amounts of debt 
 the purpose of the bill is to put the <unk> on airline acquisitions that would so load a carrier up with debt that it would <unk> safety or a carrier 's ability to compete rep. john paul <unk> r. ark said 
 the bill as it was approved by the house public works and transportation committee would give the transportation department up to N days to review any purchase of N N or more of the stock in an airline 
 the department would be required to block the buy-out if the acquisition is likely to financially weaken a carrier so that safety would be <unk> its ability to compete would be sharply diminished it would be put into foreign control or if the transaction would result in the sale of <unk> assets unless selling such assets had an <unk> public benefit 
 the house approved an amendment offered by rep. peter <unk> d. ore. that would in addition to the previous criteria also require the department to block the acquisition of an airline if the added debt incurred were likely to result in a reduction in the number of the carrier 's employees or their wages or benefits 
 rep. james <unk> d. ohio said the amendment which passed N would let the american worker know that we consider them occasionally 
 but rep. <unk> said that the provision which he dubbed a special interest amendment was likely to make the bill even more controversial 
 on tuesday the house approved a <unk> amendment that would require the transportation department to reject airline acquisitions if the person seeking to purchase a carrier had run two or more airlines previously that have filed for protection from creditors under chapter N of the federal bankruptcy code 
 the provision called the <unk> amendment by its supporters apparently was aimed at preventing texas air corp. chairman frank lorenzo from attempting to take over another airline 
 <unk> report 
 you now may drop by the voice of america offices in washington and read the text of what the voice is broadcasting to those N million people around the world who tune in to it each week 
 you can even take notes extensive notes for the voice folks wo n't look over your shoulder about what you read 
 you can do all this even if you 're not a reporter or a researcher or a scholar or a member of congress 
 and my newspaper can print the text of those <unk> 
 until the other day you as an ordinary citizen of this democracy had no right to see what your government was telling your <unk> around the world 
 that was the law 
 and i apparently had no right to print <unk> what the voice was booming to <unk> 
 it was censorship 
 it was <unk> 
 and it was stupid 
 the theory was that the voice is a propaganda agency and this government should n't <unk> its own people 
 that sounds neat but this government any government <unk> its own people every day 
 government press releases <unk> <unk> tours of military facilities publications are all propaganda of sorts 
 propaganda is just information to support a viewpoint and the beauty of a democracy is that it enables you to hear or read every viewpoint and then make up your own mind on an issue 
 the restrictions on <unk> and <unk> of voice material were especially absurd an agency in the information business was not being allowed to inform 
 in june N i wrote in this space about this issue 
 assuming it was n't one of those columns that you <unk> and put on the <unk> door i 'll review the facts 
 the voice of america is a government agency that <unk> news and views some might say propaganda in N <unk> to N million <unk> around the world 
 it does a <unk> job 
 its budget $ N million is paid for by you 
 but a N law barred the <unk> of that material in the u.s. 
 the law let scholars reporters and researchers read <unk> of <unk> material only at <unk> headquarters in washington but it barred them from copying <unk> 
 and of course there 's that word <unk> 
 how 's that again 
 you may come by the agency to read but not copy either <unk> or by <unk> a voice official explained when i asked 
 what if i tune in my <unk> radio <unk> an editorial or program and print it in my newspaper 
 nor are you free to <unk> such material i was advised 
 that sounded a lot like censorship so after years of letters and conversations that went nowhere i sued 
 a couple of weeks ago i lost the case in federal district court in des <unk> 
 at least that 's the way it was reported 
 and indeed the lawsuit was dismissed 
 but i i like to think of it in terms of we all of us won the point 
 for a funny thing happened on the way to the ruling the united states information agency which runs the voice changed its position on three key points 
 the usia said that on reflection of course i could print anything i could get my hands on 
 the word <unk> it decided referred only to itself 
 the usia officially and publicly declared the <unk> right of everyone except the usia to <unk> agency program materials in the united states my lawyer the <unk> mark mccormick of des <unk> said in a memo pointing out the facts and trying to make me feel good after the press reported that i had lost 
 the court noted the new usia position but just in case officially found that congress did not intend to preclude plaintiffs from <unk> usia information domestically 
 the usia said that on reflection anyone could view the <unk> materials not just the reporters scholars researchers and congressmen who are mentioned in the statute 
 the usia publicly and officially stated in the litigation that all persons are allowed access to the materials notwithstanding the statutory <unk> because the usia has determined that it will not check the credentials of any person appearing and <unk> to see the materials mr. mccormick noted 
 and the usia said that all of us could take extensive notes 
 the agency publicly and officially declared in the lawsuit that persons who examine the materials may make notes and while the agency position is that persons may not take <unk> notes no one will check to determine what notes a person has taken mr. mccormick reported 
 i had sought in my suit the right to print voice material which had been denied me and i had sought a right to receive the information arguing in effect that a right to print government information is n't very helpful if i have no right to get the information 
 but the court disagreed 
 the first amendment <unk> the government from passing laws <unk> the right to free speech judge donald o'brien ruled 
 the first amendment does not <unk> a duty upon the government to assure easy access to information for members of the press 
 so now the situation is this 
 you have a right to read voice of america scripts if you do n't mind traveling to washington every week or so and visiting the voice office during business hours 
 i have a right to print those scripts if i go there and <unk> but no longer <unk> copy them out in long hand 
 but neither of us can copy the material on a xerox machine or have it sent to us 
 in an era when every government agency has a public-relations machine that sends you stuff whether you want it or not this does seem odd 
 indeed judge o'brien ruled that it would be easy to conclude that the usia 's position is inappropriate or even stupid but it 's the law 
 so the next step i suspect is to try to get the law changed 
 we i assume you 're in this with me at this point need to get three words for examination only eliminated from the law 
 section N of the united states information and educational exchange act of N says voice material shall be available to certain of us but now thanks to the usia 's new position all of us for examination only 
 if those words were n't there the nice people at the voice would be able to send you the information or at the very least let you <unk> it 
 this is not a <unk> issue 
 you have raised important questions which ought to be answered what does usia say about america abroad how do we say it and how can american taxpayers get the answers to these questions a man wrote me a couple of years ago 
 the man was charles <unk> <unk> 
 at the time he was director of the 
 he had no answers then 
 now there are some 
 this democracy is suddenly a little more democratic 
 i feel pretty good about it 
 mr. gartner is editor and <unk> of the daily tribune in <unk> iowa and president of nbc news in new york 
 r. gordon mcgovern was forced out as campbell soup co. 's president and chief executive officer the strongest evidence yet of the power that dorrance family members intend to <unk> in <unk> the troubled food company 
 herbert m. baum the <unk> president of the company 's campbell u.s.a. unit and edwin l. harper N the chief financial officer will run campbell as a team <unk> responsibilities rather evenly until a successor is named 
 the board already has been searching for strong outside candidates including <unk> executives with considerable international experience 
 wall street reacted <unk> to mr. mcgovern 's departure and its implications 
 in heavy trading on the new york stock exchange campbell 's shares rose $ N to close at $ N 
 the profit motive of the major shareholders has clearly changed for the better said john <unk> a food industry analyst for prudential-bache in new york 
 mr. mcgovern was widely seen as sales and not profit <unk> 
 new managers would think a little more like wall street mr. <unk> added 
 some of the surge in the stock 's price appeared to be linked to revived takeover speculation which has contributed to volatility of campbell shares in recent months 
 campbell 's international businesses particularly in the u.k. and italy appear to be at the heart of its problems 
 growth has fallen short of targets and operating earnings are far below results in u.s. units 
 for example campbell is a distant third in the u.k. frozen foods market where it recently paid N times earnings for <unk> foods plc and wound up with far more capacity than it could use 
 similarly campbell 's italian <unk> operation d. <unk> & co. has been hurt by <unk> and distribution problems 
 such problems will require considerable <unk> to resolve 
 however neither mr. baum nor mr. harper has much international experience 
 mr. baum a <unk> marketer who is said to have a good <unk> with campbell employees will have responsibility for all domestic operations except the <unk> farm unit 
 mr. harper a veteran of several manufacturing companies who joined campbell in N will take charge of all overseas operations as well as <unk> 
 in an joint interview yesterday both men said they would like to be the company 's next chief executive 
 mr. mcgovern N had been under intense pressure from the board to boost campbell 's <unk> performance to the level of other food companies 
 the board is dominated by the <unk> of the late john t. dorrance jr. who controlled about N N of campbell 's stock when he died in april 
 in recent months mr. dorrance 's children and other family members have pushed for improved profitability and higher returns on their equity 
 in august the company took a $ N million pretax charge against fiscal N earnings when it announced a world-wide restructuring plan 
 the plan calls for closing at least nine plants and eliminating about N jobs 
 but analysts said early results from the reorganization have been disappointing especially in europe and there were signs that the board became <unk> 
 campbell officials said mr. mcgovern was n't available yesterday to discuss the circumstances of his departure 
 the company 's prepared statement quoted him as saying the ceo succession is well along and i 've decided for personal reasons to take early retirement 
 but people familiar with the agenda of the board 's meeting last week in london said mr. mcgovern was fired 
 mr. mcgovern himself had said repeatedly that he intended to stay on until he reached the conventional retirement age of N in october N unless i get fired 
 campbell said mr. mcgovern had withdrawn his name as a candidate for re-election as a director at the annual shareholder meeting scheduled for nov. N 
 for fiscal N mr. mcgovern received a salary of $ N 
 he owns about N shares of campbell stock and has options to buy more than N additional shares 
 he will be eligible for an annual pension of more than $ N with certain other <unk> benefits 
 during mr. mcgovern 's <unk> term as president the company 's sales rose to $ N billion from $ N billion and net income increased to $ N million from $ N million the statement said 
 mr. baum said he and mr. harper both <unk> closing some plants as long ago as early N 
 you 've got to make the restructuring work said mr. baum 
 you 've got to make those savings now 
 mr. harper expressed confidence that he and mr. baum can convince the board of their <unk> to run the company 
 we look upon this as a great opportunity to prove the fact that we have a tremendous management team he said 
 he predicted that the board would give the current duo until early next year before naming a new chief executive 
 mr. baum said the two have orders to focus on <unk> profits and to take a hard look at our businesses what is good what is not so good 
 analysts generally <unk> the performance of campbell u.s.a. the company 's largest division which posted N N unit sales growth and a N N improvement in operating profit for fiscal N 
 the way that we 've been managing campbell u.s.a. can hopefully spread to other areas of the company mr. baum said 
 in the interview at headquarters yesterday afternoon both men <unk> confidence and seemed to work well together 
 you 've got two <unk> sitting right before you said mr. baum

 robert l. bernstein chairman and president of random house inc. announced his resignation from the publishing house he has run for N years 
 a successor was n't named which fueled speculation that mr. bernstein may have <unk> with <unk> newhouse jr. whose family company advance publications inc. owns random house 
 abrupt departures are n't <unk> of within the newhouse empire 
 in an interview mr. bernstein said his departure <unk> out of discussions with <unk> newhouse and that 's the decision i reached 
 he declined to elaborate other than to say it just seemed the right thing to do at this minute 
 sometimes you just go with your gut 
 mr. bernstein said he will stay until dec. N and work with his successor who is to be named soon 
 mr. newhouse meanwhile insisted that he is n't unhappy with mr. bernstein or the performance of random house the largest trade publishing house in the u.s. 
 the company said the publisher 's annual sales volume increased to $ N million from $ N million during mr. bernstein 's tenure 
 bob has handled the extraordinary growth of the company quite <unk> said mr. newhouse 
 the company is doing well it 's stable it 's got good people 
 bob has an agenda and this seemed like the natural time 
 publishing officials believe that while random house has enjoyed spectacular growth and has smoothly integrated many acquisitions in recent years some of the bigger ones have n't been absorbed so easily 
 crown publishing group acquired last year is said to be turning in disappointing results 
 as a private company random house does n't report its earnings 
 mr. bernstein who succeeded bennett <unk> has been only the second president of random house since it was founded in N 
 speculation on his successor centers on a number of division heads at the house 
 possible candidates include susan <unk> president of <unk> <unk> random house 's huge and successful <unk> division 
 some say anthony <unk> head of a recently acquired british company century hutchinson could be chosen 
 there is also speculation that mr. newhouse could bring in a powerhouse businessman or another newhouse family member to run the business side in combination with a publishing executive like robert <unk> who left random house 's alfred a. <unk> to run the new yorker also owned by the newhouse family 
 not included on the <unk> list are <unk> evans recruited two years ago to be publisher of adult trade books for random house and <unk> mehta president of the prestigious alfred a. <unk> unit 
 when ms. evans took her job several important divisions that had reported to her predecessor were n't included partly because she did n't wish to be a full-time administrator 
 mr. mehta is widely viewed as a brilliant editor but a <unk> administrator and his own departure was rumored recently 
 mr. bernstein a tall energetic man who is widely respected as a publishing executive has spent much of his time in recent years on human rights issues 
 congress learned during the reagan administration that it could <unk> the executive branch by <unk> again and again the same seven words provided that no funds shall be spent 
 this phrase once again is found throughout the many appropriations bills now moving through congress 
 it signals congress 's attempt under the <unk> of <unk> the public <unk> to deny the president the funding necessary to execute certain of his duties and prerogatives specified in article ii of the constitution 
 this <unk> of congressional action is <unk> on an interpretation of the appropriations clause that is <unk> and unconstitutional 
 the appropriations clause states that no money shall be drawn from the treasury but in consequence of appropriations made by law 
 the prevailing interpretation of the clause on capitol hill is that it gives congress an <unk> veto over every <unk> action of the president through the ability to <unk> funding 
 this interpretation was officially endorsed by congress in N in the iran-contra report 
 as <unk> of congressional power understand a power of the <unk> so broadly <unk> would <unk> the presidency and <unk> the principle of separation of powers 
 it is not supported by the text or history of the constitution 
 the <unk> hardly discussed the appropriations clause at the constitutional convention of N according to madison 's notes 
 to the extent they did their concern was to ensure fiscal accountability 
 moreover the <unk> believed that the nation needed a <unk> executive with the independence and resources to perform the executive functions that the confederation congress had performed poorly under the articles of confederation 
 it would <unk> that objective if the appropriations clause technically a <unk> on legislative power could be read as placing the president on congress 's short <unk> making the executive consist of the president and every member of congress 
 as it went to the conference panel now <unk> the appropriations bill for the executive office of the president for fiscal N contained some <unk> attempts by congress to rewrite the constitution under the <unk> of protecting the public 's money 
 during the coming weeks president bush must decide whether to veto the bills containing them or alternatively to sign these bills into law with a statement declaring their <unk> on executive power to be in violation of article ii and thus <unk> and <unk> 
 the N appropriations legislation attempts to strip the president of his powers to make certain appointments as provided by article ii 
 article ii places on the president the duty to <unk> and by and with the advice and consent of the senate <unk> <unk> judges and other officers of the u.s. 
 it also <unk> the president to make <unk> appointments without senate approval the president shall have power to fill up all <unk> that may happen during the <unk> of the senate by granting commissions which shall expire at the end of their next session 
 yet section N of the appropriations bill for the executive office provides no part of any <unk> for the current fiscal year contained in this or any other act shall be paid to any person for the filling of any position for which he or she has been <unk> after the senate has voted not to approve the nomination of said person 
 thus with one brief passage in an appropriations bill congress <unk> the president 's power to make <unk> appointments under article ii 
 section N also imposes unconstitutional conditions on the president 's ability to <unk> candidates of his choosing 
 the language of the appropriations rider implies that any nomination to any position of a rejected <unk> will result in the president being denied funding to pay that person 's salary 
 the president could probably not avoid this restriction by choosing people willing to serve without pay because the <unk> act prohibits voluntary service to the government 
 the N appropriations bills also contain a number of <unk> provisions that violate the recommendation clause in article ii of the constitution 
 <unk> provisions which might be called <unk> laws as well prevent the executive branch from even looking at certain policy options let alone from recommending them to congress 
 such laws violate the provision in article ii that requires the president to make recommendations to congress but which gives the president the discretion to select the subject matter of those recommendations 
 typically these laws seek to prevent executive branch officials from <unk> into whether certain federal programs make any economic sense or proposing more <unk> alternatives to regulations 
 probably the most <unk> example is a <unk> in the appropriations bill for the executive office that prevents the president 's office of management and budget from <unk> agricultural marketing orders to any <unk> scrutiny 
 there is something <unk> suspect about congress 's <unk> the executive from even studying whether public funds are being wasted in some favored program or other 
 perhaps none of the unconstitutional conditions contained in the appropriations bills for fiscal N better illustrates congress 's attempt to <unk> executive power than section N of the <unk> bill none of the funds made available <unk> to the provisions of this act shall be used to implement <unk> or enforce any regulation which has been <unk> <unk> to a resolution of <unk> <unk> adopted in <unk> with the applicable law of the united states 
 this provision amounts to a legislative veto over the president 's execution of the law since a <unk> resolution could be said to be <unk> adopted even though it would require neither <unk> action in congress nor presentation to the president for his signature or veto 
 the supreme court 's decision in <unk> v. <unk> held that legislative <unk> are unconstitutional 
 president bush should veto appropriations acts that contain these kinds of unconstitutional conditions on the president 's ability to <unk> his duties and exercise his prerogatives 
 if president bush fails to do so in his first year he will <unk> congress for the remainder of his presidency to rewrite article ii of the constitution to suit its purposes 
 what becomes custom in the bush administration will only become more difficult for future presidents including democrats to undo 
 president reagan learned that lesson 
 by N <unk> jim wright was discussing arms control in moscow with mikhail gorbachev and then attempting to direct the president through an appropriations rider to treat the soviets as though the senate had ratified salt ii 
 if a veto is <unk> because it would leave part of the executive branch <unk> the president could sign the appropriations bills into law and <unk> a power of <unk> declaring the rider restricting his article ii powers to be unconstitutional and <unk> 
 the constitution does not <unk> give the president such power 
 however the president does have a duty not to violate the constitution 
 the question is whether his only means of defense is the veto 
 <unk> of appropriations riders that trespass on the president 's duties and <unk> under article ii would be different from the line-item veto 
 as discussed in the context of controlling federal spending the line-item veto is characterized as a way for the president to <unk> perfectly constitutional provisions in a spending bill that are <unk> merely because they conflict with his policy objectives 
 the <unk> of unconstitutional conditions in an appropriations bill would be a power of far more limited <unk> 
 one could argue that it is not an <unk> of a item veto at all for the president by <unk> a power of <unk> to resist unconstitutional conditions in legislation that violate the separation of powers 
 there is no downside if the president asserts a right of <unk> over unconstitutional conditions in the fiscal N appropriations bills 
 if congress does nothing president bush will have won 
 if congress takes the dispute to the supreme court assuming it can establish standing to sue president bush might win 
 in that case he might receive an opinion from the court that is a <unk> of the president 's right to perform the duties and exercise the prerogatives the <unk> thought should be <unk> to the executive 
 if president bush loses at the court it might be disappointing as morrison v. <unk> was for the reagan administration 
 but the presidency would be no worse off than it is now 
 moreover the <unk> would have received a valuable <unk> lesson in how the separation of powers works in practice 
 as it stands now congress <unk> after the reagan administration that the white house will take unconstitutional provisions in appropriations bills lying down 
 president bush should set things straight 
 if he does not he will help realize madison 's fear in the <unk> no. N of a legislature everywhere extending the <unk> of its activity and drawing all powers into its <unk> <unk> 
 mr. <unk> served as an attorney in the reagan administration 
 his longer analysis of executive power and the appropriations clause is to appear in the duke law journal later this year 
 despite one of the most devastating <unk> on record net cash income in the farm belt rose to a new high of $ N billion last year 
 the previous record was $ N billion in N according to the agriculture department 
 net cash income the amount left in farmers ' pockets after <unk> expenses from gross cash income increased in N states in N as the drought cut into crop yields and drove up commodity prices the department 's economic research service reported yesterday 
 most of those states set farm income records 
 the worst crop damage occurred in the midwestern corn belt and the northern great plains 
 what saved many farmers from a bad year was the opportunity to reclaim large quantities of grain and other crops that they had <unk> to the government under <unk> loan programs 
 with prices soaring they were able to sell the <unk> commodities at considerable profit the agency 's <unk> report said 
 in less <unk> areas meanwhile farmers who had little or no loss of production <unk> greatly from the higher prices 
 to the surprise of some analysts net cash income rose in some of the <unk> states including indiana illinois nebraska and the <unk> 
 analysts attributed the increases partly to the $ N billion <unk> package enacted by congress 
 last year 's record net cash income confirms the farm sector 's rebound from the agricultural depression of the early 1980s 
 it also helps explain the reluctance of the major farm <unk> and many lawmakers to make any significant changes in the N farm program next year 
 commodity prices have been rising in recent years with the farm price index hitting record <unk> earlier this year as the government curtailed production with <unk> programs to reduce <unk> surpluses 
 at the same time export demand for u.s. wheat corn and other commodities strengthened said keith collins a department analyst 
 farmers also benefited from strong livestock prices as the nation 's cattle inventory dropped close to a 30-year low 
 all of these forces came together in N to benefit agriculture mr. collins said 
 california led the nation with $ N billion in net cash income last year followed by texas $ N billion iowa $ N billion florida $ N billion and minnesota $ N billion 
 iowa and minnesota were among the few major farm states to <unk> a decline in net cash income 
 despite federal disaster relief the drought of N was a severe financial setback for an estimated N to N farmers according to the department 
 many lost their farms 
 department economists do n't expect N to be as good a year as N was 
 indeed net cash income is likely to fall this year as farm expenses rise and government payments to farmers decline 
 at the same time an increase of land under <unk> after the drought has boosted production of corn soybeans and other commodities causing a fall in prices that has been only partly <unk> by heavy grain buying by the soviets 
 last year government payments to farmers slipped to less than $ N billion from a record $ N billion in N 
 payments are expected to range between $ N billion and $ N billion this year 
 after years of struggling the los angeles herald examiner will publish its last edition today shut down by its parent hearst corp. following unsuccessful efforts to sell the venerable newspaper 
 the demise of the <unk> herald once the nation 's largest afternoon newspaper with circulation exceeding N turns the country 's second-largest city into a <unk> town at least in some <unk> 
 the los angeles times with a circulation of more than N million dominates the region 
 but it faces stiff competition in orange county from the orange county register which sells more than N copies a day and in the san fernando valley from the los angeles daily news which sells more than N 
 nearby cities such as pasadena and long beach also have large <unk> 
 in july closely held hearst based in new york put the paper on the block 
 speculation had it that the company was asking $ N million for an operation said to be losing about $ N million a year but others said hearst might have virtually given the paper away 
 an attempted buy-out led by john j. <unk> chief operating officer never materialized and a stream of what one staff member dismissed as <unk> and <unk> had filed through since 
 the prospective buyers included investor marvin davis and the toronto sun 
 the death of the herald a <unk> paper in a freeway town was perhaps inevitable 
 los angeles is a <unk> <unk> newspaper market and advertisers seemed to feel they could buy space in the <unk> times then target a particular area with one of the regional <unk> 
 the herald was left in limbo 
 further the herald seemed torn <unk> between keeping its <unk> hearst <unk> blue-collar and <unk> and trying to provide a <unk> upscale alternative to the sometimes <unk> times 
 hearst had <unk> with a conversion to tabloid format for years but never executed the plan 
 the herald joins the baltimore <unk> which <unk> and the boston <unk> which was sold as <unk> of the old hearst newspaper empire abandoned by the company in the 1980s 
 many felt hearst kept the paper alive as long as it did if marginally because of its place in family history 
 its <unk> offices were designed by architect <unk> morgan who built the hearst castle at san <unk> 
 william <unk> hearst had kept an apartment in the spanish <unk> building 
 analysts said the herald 's demise does n't necessarily represent the overall condition of the newspaper industry 
 the herald was a <unk> from a <unk> age said j. <unk> noble a media analyst with painewebber inc 
 actually the long deterioration in daily newspapers shows signs of coming to an end and the industry looks pretty healthy 
 founded as the examiner in N by mr. hearst the herald was <unk> by a bitter <unk> strike that began in N and cut circulation in half 
 financially it never recovered <unk> it had its moments 
 in N hearst hired editor james <unk> who <unk> the editorial product considerably 
 he and his successor mary anne <unk> restored respect for the editorial product and though in recent years the paper had been <unk> along on limited resources its <unk> were notable 
 for example the herald consistently beat its <unk> rival on disclosures about los angeles mayor tom bradley 's financial dealings 
 the herald 's sports coverage and arts criticism were also highly regarded 
 robert j. <unk> vice president and general manager of hearst newspapers stood up in the paper 's <unk> yesterday and announced that no buyers had stepped forward and that the paper would <unk> putting more than N full-time employees out of work 
 hearst said it would provide employees with a placement service and pay them for N days 
 some <unk> employees will receive additional benefits the company said 
 hours after the announcement representatives of the orange county register were in a bar across the street recruiting 
 the reaction in the <unk> was emotional 
 i 've never seen so many people <unk> in one place at one time said bill johnson an assistant city editor 
 so long l.a. was chosen as the paper 's final headline 
 i 'm doing the main story and i 'm already two beers drunk said reporter andy <unk> whom the times hired away several years ago but who returned to the herald out of preference 
 his wife also works for the paper as did his father 
 outside a young <unk> filling a news box with an extra edition <unk> herald examiner closes refused to take a reader 's quarter 
 forget it he said as he handed her a paper 
 it does n't make any difference now 
 olympia broadcasting corp. said it did n't make a $ N million semiannual interest payment due yesterday on $ N million of senior subordinated debentures 
 the <unk> owner and <unk> said it was trying to obtain additional working capital from its senior secured lenders and other financial institutions 
 it said it needs to make the payment by dec. N to avoid a default that could lead to an acceleration of the debt 
 in september the company said it was seeking offers for its five radio stations in order to concentrate on its programming business 
 if you 'd really rather have a buick do n't leave home without the american express card 
 or so the <unk> might go 
 american express co. and general motors corp. 's beleaguered buick division are joining forces in a promotion aimed at boosting buick 's sales while encouraging broader use of the american express card 
 the companies are giving four-day <unk> for two to buick buyers who charge all or part of their down payments on the american express green card 
 they have begun sending letters explaining the program which began oct. N and will end dec. N to about five million card holders 
 neither company would disclose the program 's cost 
 buick approached american express about a joint promotion because its card holders generally have a good credit history and are good at making payments says a spokeswoman for the division 
 american express also represents the upscale image we 're trying to project she adds 
 buick has been seeking for the past few years to restore its reputation as the doctor 's car a product for upscale professionals 
 sales were roughly flat in the N model year compared with a year earlier though industry sales fell 
 but since the N model year began oct. N buick sales have plunged N N 
 for american express the promotion is part of an effort to broaden the use of its card for retail sales where the company expects to get much of the future growth in its card business 
 traditionally the card has been used mainly for travel and entertainment expenses 
 <unk> <unk> an american express executive vice president says the promotion with buick is his company 's first with an auto maker but hopefully will be the first of many in the company 's effort to promote its green card as the total <unk> card 
 to that end american express has been signing up gasoline companies car repair shops tire companies and car dealers to accept the card 
 many auto dealers now let car buyers charge part or all of their purchase on the american express card but few card holders realize this mr. <unk> says 
 until now however buyers who wanted to finance part of a car purchase through general motors acceptance corp. could n't put their down payment on a charge card because of possible conflicts with <unk> and state disclosure laws over finance rates says a spokesman for the gm finance arm 
 but gmac approved the buick program he says because the american express green card requires payment in full upon billing and so does n't carry any finance rates 
 mr. <unk> says american express considers gm and buick very sophisticated direct-mail marketers so by joining forces with them we have managed to maximize our direct-mail capability 
 in addition buick is a relatively respected <unk> among american express card holders says an american express spokeswoman 
 when the company asked members in a mailing which cars they would like to get information about for possible future purchases buick came in fourth among u.s. cars and in the top N of all cars the spokeswoman says 
 american express has more than N million card holders in the u.s. and over half have the green card 
 gmac <unk> the <unk> list for holders more than N years old with household incomes over $ N who had n't missed any payments the buick spokeswoman says 
 some N million of the five million who will get letters were <unk> for credit with gmac 
 these N million people also are eligible to get one percentage point off gmac 's advertised finance rates which start at N N for two-year loan contracts 
 a spokesman for visa international 's u.s. subsidiary says his company is using promotions to increase use of its cards but does n't have plans for a <unk> similar to the american <unk> link 
 three divisions at american express are working with buick on the promotion the establishment services division which is responsible for all merchants and companies that accept the card the travel division and the merchandise sales division 
 the vacation packages include hotel <unk> and in some cases tours or tickets to local <unk> but not meals 
 <unk> are chicago <unk> las vegas nev. los angeles miami beach fla. new orleans new york <unk> fla. san francisco and washington d.c. 
 a buyer who chooses to fly to his <unk> must pay for his own ticket but gets a companion 's ticket free if they fly on united airlines 
 in <unk> of the vacation buyers can choose among several prizes including a <unk> <unk> or a stereo videocassette recorder 
 card holders who receive the letter also are eligible for a <unk> with buick cars or a hawaii vacation as prizes 
 if they <unk> a buick they get an american express <unk> 
 this is n't buick 's first <unk> promotion 
 a few years ago the company offered two <unk> tickets on trans world airlines to buyers of its <unk> luxury car 
 the promotion helped <unk> sales exceed the division 's forecast by more than N N buick said at the time 
 the united kingdom high court declared illegal a variety of interest-rate swap transactions and options deals between a london borough council and commercial banks 
 the ruling could lead to the cancellation of huge bank debts the london borough of <unk> and <unk> ran up after losing heavily on swap transactions 
 as many as N u.k. and international banks stand to lose several hundred million pounds should the decision be upheld and set a precedent for other municipalities 
 an appeal is expected 
 in response to the ruling <unk> futures swiftly plunged more than a point yesterday before recovering much of the loss by the end of the session 
 <unk> or british government bonds which also fell sharply initially <unk> some of the losses to end about N point lower 
 the council which is alleged to have engaged in over N deals valued at over # N billion $ N billion lost millions of pounds from <unk> swap deals 
 at one point <unk> is reported to have accounted for as much as N N of the sterling market in interest-rate swap dealings 
 when two parties engage in an interest-rate swap they are betting against each other on future rates 
 thus an institution obligated to make fixed-rate interest payments on debt swaps the payments with another making floating-rate payments 
 in most of the british transactions the municipalities agreed to make floating-rate payments to banks which would make fixed-rate payments 
 as interest rates rose municipalities owed the banks more than the banks were paying them 
 the court hearing began in early october at the request of anthony <unk> district <unk> for <unk> who argued that local <unk> are n't vested with constitutional authority to engage in such <unk> activities 
 the council backed the audit commission 's stand that the swap transactions are illegal 
 although the <unk> and <unk> council was by far the most active local authority engaging in such <unk> transactions the court decision could set a precedent for similar transactions by N other local <unk> 
 while this court ruling was only on <unk> it will obviously be very <unk> in other cases of a similar nature a <unk> representing one of the banks said 
 already N local <unk> have refused to honor fees and payments to banks incurred during various swaps dealings 
 other financial institutions involved include barclays bank plc midland bank plc security pacific corp. chemical banking corp. 's chemical bank citicorp 's citibank and mitsubishi finance international 
 if the banks <unk> all <unk> of appeal it is possible that they would seek to have the <unk> ruling work both ways some market sources said 
 banks could seek to recover payments to local authorities in <unk> where the banks made net payments to <unk> 
 officials from the various banks involved are expected to meet during the next few days to consider other arrangements with local authorities that could be questionable 
 the banks have N days to file an appeal against the ruling and are expected to do so shortly 
 in the aftermath of the stock market 's <unk> 190-point drop on oct. N kidder peabody & co. 's N stockbrokers across the country began a telephone and <unk> campaign aimed at <unk> the country 's second-largest program trader 
 the target of their <unk> 
 their own employer kidder peabody 
 since october 's <unk> wall street has been shaken by an explosion of <unk> against program trading the computer-driven <unk> trades of huge baskets of stocks and futures that can send stock prices reeling in minutes 
 but the <unk> fight over program trading is about much more than a volatile stock market 
 the real battle is over who will control that market and reap its huge rewards 
 program trading itself according to many <unk> who have studied it is merely caught in the middle of this battle unfairly labeled as the evil driving force of the marketplace 
 the evidence indicates that program trading did n't in fact cause the market 's sharp fall on oct. N though it may have <unk> it 
 on one side of this power struggle stand the forces in <unk> on wall street the new guard consisting of high-tech computer <unk> at the major brokerage firms their pension fund clients with <unk> pools of money and the traders at the fast-growing chicago futures exchanges 
 these are the main proponents of program trading 
 defending their <unk> are wall street 's old guard the traditional <unk> money managers tens of thousands of stock brokers the new york stock exchange 's listed companies and the <unk> floor traders known as specialists who make markets in their stocks 
 so far wall street 's old guard seems to be winning the program-trading battle successfully <unk> public and congressional opinion to <unk> their <unk> 
 the chicago mercantile exchange a major futures marketplace yesterday announced the addition of another layer of trading halts designed to slow program traders during a rapidly falling stock market and the big board is expected today to approve some additional restrictions on program trading 
 <unk> by charges that their greed is turning the stock market into a <unk> <unk> almost all the big investment banking houses have abandoned index arbitrage a common form of program trading for their own accounts in the past few days 
 a few such as giant merrill lynch & co. now refuse even to do index arbitrage trades for clients 
 the old guard 's assault on program trading and its practitioners has been fierce and broad-based in part because some old guard members feel their very <unk> is at stake 
 some such as traditional money manager neuberger & <unk> have taken out national newspaper advertisements demanding that market regulators stop the numbers <unk> on wall street 
 big board stock specialists in a bold palace <unk> began shortly after oct. N to telephone the corporate executives of the companies whose stock is listed on the big board to have them pressure the exchange to ban program trading 
 charles wohlstetter the chairman of contel corp. who is <unk> other <unk> to the <unk> trading cause says he has received <unk> letters offering support 
 they said <unk> without a single exception do n't even compromise 
 kill it he says 
 wall street 's new guard is n't likely to take all this lying down for long however 
 its new products and trading techniques have been highly profitable 
 program trading money managers have gained control over a big chunk of the invested funds in this country and the pressures on such money managers to produce consistent profits has <unk> them to the ability to move rapidly in and out the market that program trading gives them 
 what 's more the last time major wall street firms said they were getting out of program trading in the aftermath of the N crash they waited a few months and then <unk> back into it 
 even some members of the old guard despite their current advantage seem to be <unk> that the future belongs with the new guard 
 last week robert m. bradley one of the big board 's most respected floor traders and head of a major traders ' organization surrendered 
 he sold his exchange seat and wrote a bitter letter to big board chairman john j. phelan jr. in which he said the big board is too focused on machines rather than people 
 he said the exchange is headed for a real crisis if program trading is n't <unk> 
 i do not want my money invested in what i consider as nothing more than a casino mr. bradley wrote 
 the battle has turned into a civil war at some firms and organizations causing internal <unk> and <unk> employee against employee 
 at kidder a unit of general electric co. and other big brokerage firms stockbrokers battle their own firm 's program traders a few floors away 
 corporations like contel <unk> program trading yet contel has in the past hired pension fund managers like bankers trust co. that are also big program traders 
 the big board the nation 's premier stock exchange is sharply divided between its floor traders and its top executives 
 its entrenched N stock specialists firms are fighting <unk> and <unk> against programs 
 but the big board 's leadership over the specialists ' protests two weeks ago began trading a new stock basket product designed to facilitate program trading 
 a lot of people would like to go back to N before program trading mr. phelan said this week 
 i would like to go back to N 
 but we are not going back to N 
 again and again program-trading 's critics raise the casino theme 
 they say greedy market <unk> have made a <unk> of the nation 's <unk> system turning the stock market into a big gambling <unk> with the odds heavily <unk> against the small investor 
 the public did n't come to the market to play a game they can go to <unk> betting for that says a. <unk> murray chairman of <unk> murray foster securities a traditional money management firm 
 the program traders on the other hand <unk> old-fashioned stock pickers as the <unk> of the industry 
 critics like mr. murray are looking for <unk> and people who use computers to trade are a convenient <unk> says j. thomas allen president of advanced investment management inc. a pittsburgh firm that runs a $ N million fund that uses index arbitrage 
 just a blind fear of the unknown is causing them to <unk> the regulators for protection 
 for all the furor there is nothing particularly complex about the concept of stock-index arbitrage the most controversial type of <unk> program trading 
 like other forms of arbitrage it merely seeks to take advantage of <unk> discrepancies in the price of a single product in this case a basket of stocks in different markets in this case the new york stock exchange and the chicago futures markets 
 that divergence is what stock index traders seek 
 when it occurs the traders place orders via computers to buy the basket of stocks such as the N stocks that constitute the standard & poor 's N stock index in whichever market is cheaper and sell them in the more expensive market they lock in the difference in price as profit 
 such program trades which can involve the purchase or sale of millions of dollars of stock occur in a matter of seconds 
 a program trade of $ N million of stock typically earns a <unk> profit of $ N 
 to keep program-trading units profitable in the eyes of senior brokerage executives traders must seize every opportunity their computers find 
 the speed with which such program trades take place and the volatile price movements they can cause are what program trading critics <unk> to <unk> 
 if you continue to do this the investor becomes frightened any investor the odd <unk> mutual funds and pension funds says larry <unk> managing partner at neuberger & <unk> 
 but many experts and traders say that program trading is n't the main reason for stock-market gyrations 
 i have not seen one <unk> of evidence to support restrictions on program trading says a <unk> university finance professor <unk> stoll an authority on the subject 
 says the big board 's mr. phelan volatility is greater than program trading 
 the oct. N plunge was triggered not by program traders but by news of the <unk> of the $ N billion buy-out of ual corp 
 unable to unload ual and other airline shares takeover-stock speculators or risk arbitragers dumped every blue-chip stock they had 
 while program trades swiftly kicked in a circuit breaker that halted trading in stock futures in chicago made some program trading impossible 
 susan del <unk> head trader at travelers investment management co. says critics are ignoring the role the takeover stock <unk> is taking in the market as a source of volatility 
 many <unk> are <unk> she says and they have to sell when things look like they fall apart 
 like virtually everything on wall street the program-trading battle is over money and the <unk> have been losing out on <unk> of it to the new guard in recent years 
 take the traditional money managers or stock pickers as they are <unk> known among the computer <unk> 
 traditional stock managers like to charge N cents to N cents for every $ N they manage for big institutional investors and higher fees for smaller investors 
 yet many such managers consistently fail to even keep up with much less beat the returns of standard <unk> like the s&p 
 not surprisingly <unk> money managers have been losing clients to giant stock-index funds that use computers to <unk> portfolios so they mirror the s&p N 
 the <unk> charge only a few pennies per $ N managed 
 today about $ N billion or N N of all <unk> stock investments is held by index funds 
 the new wall street of computers and automated trading threatens to make <unk> of the N big board <unk> firms 
 these small but influential floor brokers long have earned fat returns of N N to N N a year on their capital by virtue of their monopoly in making markets in individual stocks 
 the specialists see any step to electronic trading as a death <unk> 
 and they believe the big board under mr. phelan has abandoned their interest 
 the son of a specialist and once one himself mr. phelan has nonetheless been <unk> with products like the new stock basket that his former colleagues dislike so much to keep index funds and other program traders from taking their business to overseas markets 
 meanwhile specialists ' trading risks have skyrocketed as a result of stock-market volatility 
 when the sell programs hit you can hear the order printers start to go on the big board trading floor says one specialist there 
 the buyers walk away and the specialist is left alone as the buyer of last resort for his stable of stocks he contends 
 no one is more unhappy with program trading than the nation 's stockbrokers 
 they are still trying to lure back small investors spooked by the N stock-market crash and the market 's swings since then 
 small investors are absolutely <unk> that wall street is <unk> the deck against them and these wide swings are scaring them to death says raymond a. mason chairman of regional broker legg mason inc. in baltimore 
 stockbrokers ' business and pay has been falling 
 last year the average broker earned $ N N N lower than in N 
 corporate executives <unk> that their company 's stock has been transformed into a <unk> piece of a stock-index basket 
 index traders who buy all N stocks in the s&p N often do n't even know what the companies they own actually do complains andrew <unk> chairman of champion international corp 
 do you make <unk> or <unk> 
 oh you 're in the paper business is one reaction mr. <unk> says he 's gotten from his big institutional shareholders 
 by this september program traders were doing a record N N of the big board 's average daily trading volume 
 among the top practitioners were wall street blue <unk> morgan stanley & co. kidder peabody merrill lynch salomon brothers inc. and painewebber group inc 
 but then came oct. N and the negative publicity <unk> by the old guard particularly against index arbitrage 
 the <unk> ' strategy for the moment is to <unk> down and let the furor die 
 there 's a <unk> psychology right now says the top program-trading official at a wall street firm 
 wall street 's cash <unk> has been <unk> but i do n't think anyone has proven that index arbitrage is the problem 
 too much money is at stake for program traders to give up 
 for example stock-index futures began trading in chicago in N and within two years they were the fastest-growing futures contract ever launched 
 stock futures trading has <unk> dozens of <unk> in their <unk> and <unk> 
 now on a good day chicago 's stock-index traders trade more dollars worth of stock futures than the big board trades in stock 
 now the stage is set for the battle to play out 
 the <unk> are getting some helpful <unk> from congress 
 program traders ' power to create total panic is so great that they ca n't be allowed to have their way says rep. edward markey a massachusetts democrat 
 we have to have a system that says to those largest investors 
 sit down 
 you will not panic 
 you will not put the financial system in jeopardy 
 but the prospects for legislation that targets program trading is unlikely anytime soon 
 many people including the big board think that it 's too late to put the <unk> back in the bottle 
 the big board 's directors meet today to approve some program-trading restrictions but a total ban is n't being considered big board officials say 
 you 're not going to stop the idea of trading a basket of stocks says <unk> 's prof. stoll 
 program trading is here to stay and computers are here to stay and we just need to understand it 
 short of a total ban some <unk> have proposed several <unk> reforms which they say would take away certain advantages program traders currently enjoy in the marketplace that other investors do n't 
 one such proposal regarding stock-index futures is an increase in the margin requirement or the <unk> payment of cash needed to trade them to about the same level as the margin requirement for stocks 
 currently margins on stock futures purchases are much lower roughly N N compared with N N for stocks making the futures market much faster and potentially more speculative 
 program trading critics also want the federal reserve board rather than the futures industry to set such margins 
 futures traders respond that low margins help keep their markets active 
 higher margins would chase away dozens of smaller traders who help larger traders buy and sell they say 
 another proposed reform is to have program traders answer to an uptick rule a reform instituted after the great crash of N that protects against stocks being <unk> beaten downward by those seeking to profit from lower prices namely short sellers 
 the big board 's uptick rule prevents the short sale of a stock when the stock is falling in price 
 but in N program traders received what amounted to an exemption from the uptick rule in certain situations to make it easier to link the stock and futures markets 
 a <unk> of the uptick rule for program traders would slow their activity considerably 
 program traders argue that a <unk> of the rule would destroy the pricing efficiency of the futures and stock markets 
 james a. white contributed to this article 
 <unk> <unk> 
 big board chairman john phelan said yesterday that he could support letting federal regulators suspend program trading during wild <unk> swings 
 thus the <unk> psychology of recent days picks up new impetus 
 index arbitrage is a common form of program trading 
 as usually practiced it takes advantage of a rather basic concept two separate markets in different locations trading basically the same <unk> ca n't trade them for long at prices that are widely different 
 in index arbitrage the widget is the s&p N and its price is constantly compared between the futures market in chicago and the stock markets largely in new york 
 to profit from an index-arbitrage opportunity someone who owns the s&p N widget in new york must sell it and replace it with a cheaper s&p N widget in chicago 
 if the money manager performing this service is being paid by his clients to match or beat the return of the s&p N index he is likely to remain fully invested at all times 
 few if any <unk> managers will risk <unk> performance by owning more than N N exposure to stocks and equally few will want to own less than a N N position should stocks rise 
 by constantly seeking to own the cheapest widget index-arbitrage traders hope to add between N N and N N to the annual return of the s&p N 
 that represents a very thin excess return certainly far less than what most fundamental stock pickers claim to seek as their performance objective 
 the fact that a vast majority of <unk> money managers fail to beat the s&p N may contribute to the <unk> surrounding the issue 
 as more managers pursue the index-arbitrage strategy these small opportunities between markets will be reduced and eventually eliminated 
 the current opportunities arise because the process for executing a buy or sell order in the actual stocks that make up the s&p N is more <unk> than <unk> in the futures market 
 the new york stock exchange 's attempt to introduce a new portfolio basket is evidence of investors ' <unk> to make fast and easy transactions of large numbers of shares 
 so if index arbitrage is simply taking advantage of thin <unk> between two markets for the same widget how did program trading <unk> into the evil <unk> that is <unk> the <unk> of so many observers 
 all arguments against program trading even those pressed without fact conclude with three expected results after reforms are implemented N reduced volatility N a long-term investment focus and N a level playing field for the small investor 
 but many of these reforms are <unk> even harmful 
 reducing volatility 
 an index-arbitrage trade is never executed unless there is sufficient difference between the markets in new york and chicago to cover all transaction costs 
 arbitrage does n't cause volatility it <unk> to it 
 think about what causes the difference in prices between the two markets for s&p N stocks usually it is large investors <unk> a buy or sell in chicago 
 a large investor will likely cause the futures market to decline when he sells his futures 
 arbitrage simply transfers his selling pressure from chicago to new york while <unk> as a buyer in chicago 
 the start of the whole process is the key someone must fundamentally increase or decrease his ownership in <unk> to make widget prices move 
 why does this large hypothetical seller trade in chicago instead of new york 
 perhaps he is willing to sacrifice to the arbitrage trader some small profit in order to get quick and certain execution of his large trade 
 in a competitive market this investor has many ways to execute his transactions and he will have more alternatives both foreign and domestic if his volume is profitable for an exchange to handle 
 if not chicago then in new york if not the u.s. then overseas 
 volatility surrounding his trades occurs not because of index arbitrage but because his is a large addition or <unk> to a widget market with <unk> liquidity 
 eliminate arbitrage and liquidity will decline instead of rising creating more volatility instead of less 
 the speed of his transaction is n't to be feared either because faster and cleaner execution is desirable not <unk> 
 if slowing things down could reduce volatility stone <unk> should become the trade ticket of the future 
 encouraging long-term investing 
 we must be very cautious about <unk> investors as long-term or short-term 
 policies designed to encourage one type of investor over another are <unk> to placing a sign over the big board 's door saying buyers welcome sellers please go away 
 the ultimate goal of any investor is a profit motive and regulators should not concern themselves with whether investors are sufficiently focused on the long term 
 a free market with a profit motive will attract each investor to the liquidity and risks he can <unk> 
 in point of fact volatility as measured by the annualized standard deviation of daily stock price movements has frequently been much higher than it is today 
 periods before the advent of futures or program trading were often more volatile usually when fundamental market conditions were <unk> change N N and N for example 
 it is interesting to see the fundamental stock pickers <unk> <unk> on program trading when the markets decline while <unk> the great values still <unk> as the markets rise 
 could rising volatility possibly be related to uncertainty about the economics of stocks instead of the evil <unk> of program-trading <unk> 
 some of the proposed <unk> for what is labeled program-trading volatility could be far worse than the perceived problem 
 in using program trading as a <unk> boy <unk> investors stand to gain the high ground in wooing small investors for their existing <unk> products 
 they may however risk bringing some damaging <unk> from outside the markets themselves 
 how does a nice new tax say N N on any financial transaction sound 
 that ought to make sure we 're all thinking for the long term 
 getting a level playing field 
 this argument is perhaps the most interesting one for <unk> program trading not because of its merits but because of the firms <unk> the cause 
 the <unk> of these reformers are money managers who cater to smaller investors 
 they continually advise their clients on which individual stocks to buy or sell while their clients continue to hope for superior performance 
 even with mutual funds the little investor continues to <unk> high fees high commissions and poor performance while <unk> managers slowly <unk> a better record with lower fees lower commissions and less risk 
 yet our efforts are somehow less noble than those of an investment expert <unk> <unk> press <unk> on each company he follows 
 almost all new regulation is introduced in the interests of protecting the little guy and he invariably is the one least able to cope with its consequences 
 if spreads available from index arbitrage are so enormous surely any sizable mutual-fund company could profit from offering it to small investors 
 the sad reality is that the retail investor continues to pursue <unk> performers first while leaving institutions to <unk> with basis points of performance on large sums of money quarter by quarter 
 <unk> index funds just are n't <unk> enough to justify the high fees and commissions that retail customers frequently pay and that institutional customers refuse to pay 
 each new trading <unk> is likely to be beaten by institutions seeking better ways to serve their <unk> clients here or overseas 
 <unk> new trading <unk> will only make things harder on the least sophisticated investors 
 so what is next for program trading 
 left to its own devices index arbitrage will become more and more efficient making it harder and harder to do profitably 
 spreads will become so tight that it wo n't matter which market an investor chooses arbitrage will prevent him from gaining any temporary profit 
 if government or private <unk> insist however on introducing greater <unk> between the markets limits on price moves <unk> execution higher margin requirements taxation etc. the end loser will be the markets themselves 
 instead we ought to be inviting more liquidity with cheaper ways to trade and transfer capital among all participants

 some democrats in congress are warning that a complicated new funding device for the two federal antitrust agencies could result in further cutbacks in a regulatory area already reduced sharply in recent years 
 the funding mechanism which has received congressional approval and is expected to be signed by president bush would affect the antitrust operations of the justice department and the federal trade commission 
 as a part of overall efforts to reduce spending congress cut by $ N million the bush administration 's request for antitrust enforcement for fiscal N which began oct. N 
 to offset the reduction congress approved a $ N fee that investors and companies will have to pay each time they make required filings to antitrust regulators about mergers acquisitions and certain other transactions 
 some democrats led by rep. jack brooks d. texas unsuccessfully opposed the measure because they fear that the fees may not fully make up for the budget cuts 
 but justice department and ftc officials said they expect the filing fees to make up for the budget reductions and possibly exceed them 
 it could operate to <unk> our budget james <unk> the justice department 's antitrust chief said in an interview 
 under measures approved by both houses of congress the administration 's request for $ N million for the antitrust division would be cut $ N million 
 the ftc budget request of $ N million about $ N million of which would go for antitrust enforcement would also be cut by $ N million 
 the administration had requested roughly the same amount for antitrust enforcement for fiscal N as was appropriated in fiscal N 
 the offsetting fees would apply to filings made under the hart-scott-rodino act 
 under that law parties proposing mergers or acquisitions valued at $ N million or more must notify ftc and justice department antitrust regulators before completing the transactions 
 currently the government charges nothing for such filings 
 proponents of the funding arrangement predict that based on recent filing levels of more than N a year the fees will yield at least $ N million this fiscal year or $ N million more than the budget cuts 
 when you do that there is not a cut but there is in fact a program increase of $ N million each for the ftc and the justice department rep. neal smith d. iowa said during house debate 
 but rep. don edwards d. calif responded that a recession could <unk> merger activity reducing the amount of fees collected 
 the antitrust staffs of both the ftc and justice department were cut more than N N in the reagan administration and enforcement of major merger cases fell off drastically during that period 
 today is not the time to signal that congress in any way sanctions the dismal state into which antitrust enforcement has fallen mr. edwards argued 
 any money in excess of $ N million collected from the fees in fiscal N would go to the treasury at large 
 corporate lawyers said the new fees would n't inhibit many mergers or other transactions 
 though some lawyers reported that prospective <unk> were scrambling to make filings before the fees take effect government officials said they had n't noticed any surge in filings

 researchers at american telephone & telegraph co. 's bell laboratories reported they raised the electrical current-carrying capacity of new superconductor crystals by a factor of N moving the materials closer to commercial use 
 the scientists said they created small changes in the <unk> structures of the superconductors to raise the amount of current that single crystals could carry to N <unk> per square <unk> in a moderately strong magnetic field 
 the scientists said they made the advance with <unk> superconductors cooled to <unk> <unk> or minus N degrees <unk> 
 their report appears in today 's issue of the journal nature 
 the finding marks a significant step in research on bulk superconductors which are aimed at use in wires for motors <unk> <unk> and other applications 
 scientists had obtained even higher current-carrying capacity in thin films of the new superconductors but have had problems increasing the amount of current that bulk crystals could carry 
 superconductors conduct electricity without resistance when cooled 
 a family of ceramic superconductors discovered during the past three years promise new technologies such as cheaper electrical generation but only if their current-carrying capacity can be raised 
 the at&t advance shows how one aspect of the current-carrying problem can be overcome 
 but it wo n't lead to imminent use of new superconductors cautioned robert b. van dover one of the at&t researchers 
 he added that the current-carrying capacity of <unk> samples of superconductors remains too low for most practical uses because of so-called weak links between crystals 
 such <unk> materials will probably be needed for commercial applications 
 mr. van dover said the at&t team created the <unk> crystal changes by <unk> superconductor samples with neutrons a process that creates some <unk> in the samples and may not be <unk> for large-scale commercial use 
 still scientists <unk> a collective sigh of relief about the finding because it demonstrates how to overcome the <unk> <unk> problem that earlier this year was widely publicized as <unk> new superconductors ' potential 
 the problem involves the motion of small magnetic fields within superconductor crystals limiting their current-carrying capacity 
 mr. van dover said the crystal changes his team introduced apparently <unk> the magnetic fields in place preventing them from lowering current-carrying capacity 
 mr. van dover added that researchers are trying to determine precisely what crystal changes solved the problem 
 determining that may enable them to develop better ways to introduce the needed <unk> patterns 
 the at&t team also is trying to combine their latest superconductor process with <unk> growth a process discovered earlier at bell laboratories 
 the combined processes may significantly raise the current-carrying capacity of <unk> samples

 although his team lost the world series san francisco giants owner bob <unk> hopes to have a new home for them 
 he is an <unk> fan of a proposition on next week 's ballot to help build a replacement for candlestick park 
 small wonder since he 's asking san francisco taxpayers to sink up to $ N million into the new stadium 
 as san francisco digs out from the pretty big one opponents say the last thing the city can afford is an expensive new stadium 
 a stadium craze is sweeping the country 
 it 's fueled by the increasing profitability of <unk> teams 
 something like one-third of the nation 's N largest cities are thinking about new stadiums ranging from cleveland to san antonio and st. <unk> 
 most <unk> claim the new sports <unk> will be <unk> for their city 
 <unk> university economist dean <unk> <unk> at that 
 he has looked at N baseball and football stadiums and found that only one private <unk> stadium brought more money into a city than it took out 
 stadiums tend to <unk> existing wealth within a community not create more of it 
 voters generally agree when they are given a chance to decide if they want to sink their own tax dollars into a new <unk> 
 san francisco voters rejected a new <unk> two years ago 
 last month phoenix voters turned <unk> down on a $ N million stadium bond and tax proposition 
 its backers <unk> every important interest on their team a popular mayor the chamber of commerce the major media and spent $ N on promotion 
 but voters decided that if the stadium was such a good idea someone would build it himself and rejected it N N to N N 
 in san francisco its backers concede the <unk> is at best running even in the polls 
 george christopher the former san francisco mayor who built candlestick park for the giants in the 1960s wo n't <unk> the new <unk> 
 he says he had candlestick built because the giants claimed they needed N parking <unk> 
 since the new park will have only N <unk> mr. christopher thinks backers are playing some fiscal games of their own with the voters 
 stadium <unk> claim that without public money they would never be built 
 miami <unk> owner joe <unk> <unk> and he can prove it

 this stadium shows that anything government can do we can do better mr. <unk> says 
 but to moon <unk> the former new orleans mayor who helped build that city 's <unk> money-losing <unk> questions of who benefits or the bottom line are of little <unk> 
 the <unk> is an exercise in optimism a statement of faith he has said 
 it is the very building of it that is important not how much of it is used or its economics 
 an egyptian <unk> could n't have justified his <unk> any better

 wall street 's big securities firms face the prospect of having their credit ratings lowered 
 the reason risks from the firms ' new merchant banking activities are rising as revenue from the industry 's traditional business <unk> 
 the downgrading of debt issued by cs first boston inc. parent of first boston corp. by moody 's investors service inc. coupled with a moody 's announcement that shearson lehman hutton holdings inc. is under review for a possible downgrade sent <unk> through the brokerage community this week 
 with the <unk> came the <unk> that some of wall street 's biggest players are struggling to maintain the <unk> credit standing required to finance their activities profitably 
 securities firms are among the biggest issuers of commercial paper or short-term corporate <unk> which they sell to finance their daily operations 
 the biggest firms still retain the highest ratings on their commercial paper 
 but moody 's warned that shearson 's commercial paper rating could be lowered soon a move that would reduce shearson 's profit margins on its borrowings and signal trouble ahead for other firms 
 shearson is <unk> by american express co 
 just as the 1980s bull market transformed the u.s. securities business so too will the more difficult environment of the 1990s says christopher t. <unk> a moody 's vice president 
 a sweeping restructuring of the industry is possible 
 standard & poor 's corp. says first boston shearson and drexel burnham lambert inc. in particular are likely to have difficulty <unk> up their credit standing in months ahead 
 what worries <unk> concerns the most is that wall street firms are taking long-term risks with their own capital via leveraged buy-out and junk bond financings 
 that 's a departure from their traditional practice of <unk> almost all financing risks to investors 
 <unk> conventional securities financings are structured to be sold quickly wall street 's new <unk> for leveraged buy-outs and junk bonds is resulting in long-term lending commitments that stretch out for months or years 
 the recent disarray in the junk bond market suggests that brokers may become longer-term creditors than they anticipated and may face long delays in getting their money back says jeffrey <unk> a vice president at s&p which raised a warning flag for the industry in april when it downgraded cs first boston 
 wall street is facing a <unk> situation says mr. <unk> of moody 's 
 merchant banking where firms commit their own money is getting riskier and there 's less of it to go around 
 in addition he says the buy-out business is under pressure because of the junk bond collapse meaning that returns are likely to decline as the volume of junk-bond financings <unk> 
 in a leveraged buy-out a small group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed largely by borrowing with the expectation that the debt will be paid with funds generated by the acquired company 's operations or sales of its assets 
 in a recent report moody 's said it expects intense competition to occur through the rest of the century in the securities industry which combined with overcapacity will create poor prospects for profitability 
 it said that the temptation for <unk> to ease this profit pressure by taking greater risks is an additional rating factor 
 both moody 's and s&p cited first boston 's reliance in recent years on merchant banking which has been responsible for a significant portion of the closely held firm 's profit 
 the recent cash squeeze at campeau corp. first boston 's most lucrative client of the decade is proving costly to first boston because it arranged more than $ N billion of high-yield high-risk junk financings for campeau units 
 in addition a big loan that first boston made to ohio <unk> co was n't repaid on time when its $ N million junk financing for a buy-out of the <unk> company was withdrawn 
 these two exposures alone represent a very substantial portion of cs first boston 's equity moody 's said 
 total merchant banking exposures are in excess of the firm 's equity 
 cs first boston however benefits from the backing of its largest shareholder credit suisse switzerland 's third largest bank 
 shearson also has been an aggressive participant in the leveraged buy-out business 
 but its earnings became a major disappointment as its traditional retail or individual investor business showed no signs of rebounding from the slump that followed the october N stock market crash 
 in addition shearson 's listed $ N billion of capital is <unk> according to the rating concerns because it includes $ N billion of goodwill 
 shearson really only has $ N million of capital says mr. <unk> of s&p 
 a shearson spokesman said the firm is n't worried 
 a year ago moody 's also had shearson under review for possible downgrade he said 
 after two months of talks our rating was maintained 
 drexel meanwhile already competes at a disadvantage to its big wall street rivals because it has a slightly lower commercial paper rating 
 the collapse of junk bond prices and the cancellation of many junk bond financings apparently have taken their toll on closely held drexel the leading underwriter in that market 
 the firm also has been hit with big financial settlements with the government stemming from its guilty plea to six <unk> related to a big insider-trading scandal 
 drexel this year eliminated its retail or individual customer business cutting the firm 's <unk> almost in half to just over N 
 recently drexel circulated a private financial statement among several securities firms showing that its earnings performance has diminished this year from previous years 
 the firm 's capital moreover has n't grown at the same rate as in the past officials at these firms say 
 drexel remains confident of its future <unk> 
 we 're well positioned with $ N billion of capital a drexel spokesman said 
 and as a leading investment and merchant banking firm the fact that we are no longer subject to the uncertainties and <unk> of the retail business is a major plus in our view 
 moreover we 've probably been the most aggressive firm on the street in reducing costs which are down around N N over the last six months 
 lewis c. <unk> the father of the team that created the highly successful ford <unk> and mercury <unk> cars retired early after experiencing recent heart problems 
 most recently mr. <unk> N years old has been vice president of product and manufacturing engineering at ford motor co 
 but he is best known in the auto industry as the <unk> of a team <unk> approach that produced the two midsized cars that were instrumental in helping the no. N auto maker record profits in recent years and in enabling the company 's ford division to <unk> general motors corp. 's chevrolet division as the <unk> <unk> in the u.s. 
 under the so-called team <unk> approach mr. <unk> and other ford product planners sought the involvement of parts suppliers <unk> workers auto designers and financial staff members from the initial stages of the development cycle 
 the concept 's goal was to eliminate bureaucracy and make ford 's product development more responsive to consumer demands 
 it was later applied to other <unk> programs including those that produced the ford <unk> and mercury <unk> 
 ford chairman donald e. <unk> said yesterday that mr. <unk> has helped to change the world 's perception of <unk> cars 
 mr. <unk> worked at ford for N years holding a variety of car and <unk> positions 
 the limits to legal <unk> stretched another <unk> this week when the supreme court refused to hear an appeal from a case that says corporate defendants must pay damages even after proving that they could not possibly have caused the harm 
 we can understand and share the <unk> that makes judges sometimes wish to offer a kind of <unk> aid to those who 've been hurt 
 but this case is a stark lesson in how the failures of the traditional <unk> process have left the courts as the only forum this country has to debate risk technology and innovation 
 too often now a single court decision becomes the precedent for other less compelling cases 
 from the <unk> until N some two million women took the synthetic <unk> <unk> des to prevent <unk> and morning <unk> 
 the drug was approved by the food and drug administration and marketed by some N pharmaceutical companies often under generic labels 
 in the 1970s scientists reported cancer cases among the daughters of des users 
 the cases quickly went to court but the mothers of several thousand des plaintiffs could n't recall whose brand they used 
 beginning in N courts in several states including california and new york decided to suspend the <unk> rule that plaintiffs must prove that the defendants are the ones who are liable 
 courts made the assumption that all des pills were essentially the same and created a market-share test so that damages would be assessed against drug makers in the proportion of their share of the original sales 
 this has some logic 
 drug makers should n't be able to duck liability because people could n't identify precisely which identical drug was used 
 but courts quickly tumbled down a <unk> <unk> 
 just as all plaintiffs are not alike it turns out that des defendants marketed the drugs differently and may have offered different <unk> 
 the ultimate result came in <unk> v. lilly where the highest new york court expanded the market-share approach for the first time to say that drug makers that could prove <unk> <unk> 's mother did n't use their pill must still pay their share of any damages 
 but as duke university law professor william van <unk> notes by this <unk> a defendant could be held liable in new york for a bad apple even if he sold all his apples in california 
 despite the supreme court 's refusal to hear the case there are serious constitutional issues of due process and <unk> <unk> from the defendants 
 the big problem however is that there 's no guarantee that this <unk> will be limited to des or to drugs 
 the problem here goes well beyond <unk> legal doctrine 
 the california supreme court last year reversed direction to make it much harder to win des cases because the justices saw how all the pharmaceutical litigation has <unk> the introduction of new drugs 
 the court rejected strict liability for prescription drugs citing the huge hidden social costs 
 public policy favors the development and marketing of beneficial new drugs even though some risks perhaps serious ones might <unk> their introduction because drugs can save lives and reduce pain and suffering the <unk> court said 
 the california justices noted that the fear of litigation already forced the only remaining <unk> drug <unk> off the u.s. market 
 this raises the key issue what to do about people who suffer serious injuries from beneficial drugs 
 we now know that holding drug makers liable where there 's no evidence that they or anyone else knew of any risks only means the drugs wo n't be available to anyone 
 as liability expert peter <unk> tells us after the <unk> case if any drug maker <unk> an <unk> drug it 's time to sell that company 's stock short 
 we also know that the <unk> system is a <unk> way to compensate victims anyway some win the legal <unk> others get much less and <unk> lawyers take a big cut either way 
 des daughters and other victims of drugs would be better off if their cases were taken out of the courts 
 congress could create a compensation program to help such victims while protecting the national interest in encouraging new drugs 
 but a N law that supposedly replaced lawsuits over children 's <unk> with a compensation fund has predictably led to even more litigation 
 everyone by now understands that congress is utterly <unk> of writing legislation to help <unk> people without its becoming some billion-dollar <unk> 
 we have no doubt this is one reason judges in new york and justices on the supreme court are willing to trash the law in the des cases 
 they must figure that justice has to get done by somebody but know it wo n't be done by congress

 n.v <unk> said net income in the third quarter jumped N N as the company had substantially lower extraordinary charges to account for a restructuring program 
 the dutch chemical group said net income gained to N million guilders $ N million or N guilders a share from N million guilders or N guilders a share a year ago 
 the N N state-owned <unk> had eight million guilders of extraordinary charges in the latest quarter mainly to reflect one-time losses in connection with the disposal of some operations 
 the charges were offset in part by a gain from the sale of the company 's construction division 
 last year <unk> had N million guilders of extraordinary charges for the restructuring program and other transactions 
 the earnings growth also was fueled by the company 's ability to cut net financing spending by half to around N million guilders 
 also substantially lower dutch corporate tax rates helped the company keep its tax <unk> flat relative to earnings growth the company added 
 sales however were little changed at N billion guilders compared with N billion guilders

 it is these N tons that are in question for this crop year explained <unk> <unk> analyst for shearson lehman hutton new york 
 producers were granted the right earlier this year to ship sugar and the export licenses were expected to have begun to be issued yesterday 
 as a result ms. <unk> said it is believed that little or no sugar from the N crop has been shipped yet even though the crop year is six months old 
 more than a half of all sugar produced in brazil goes for alcohol production according to ms. <unk> 
 also there has been a switch in the past decade to <unk> of orange trees in areas that were previously used for cane and this change is being felt now she said 
 most important ms. <unk> noted brazilian officials said that no decision has as yet been made on the suspension of exports 
 thomas <unk> sugar analyst for painewebber in <unk> n.j. said i am highly skeptical that brazil will curtail sugar exports particularly with the price of sugar at over N cents a pound 
 above all mr. <unk> noted the situation is extremely confused 
 professional sugar people here who have strong contacts with the brazilian sugar industry have been unable to confirm the reports or get enough information to clarify the situation he said 
 it 's the type of nervous atmosphere in which a report can be put out such as the one saying exports will be suspended and no one can confirm it 
 mr. <unk> observed that the situation in brazil is also very complicated 
 on the one hand brazil started an <unk> program about N years ago to fuel a huge portion of its national fleet of cars and is now committed to this program 
 it has to weigh on the other hand the relatively high price of sugar it can earn on the export market in making decisions as to whether to produce sugar or alcohol mr. <unk> said 
 mexico which is normally a sugar exporter has had production problems in the past two years analysts said 
 last year it had to buy sugar on the world market to meet export commitments they noted

 junk-bond <unk> an ongoing securities and exchange commission investigation a drexel burnham lambert connection a <unk> buy-out rumor 
 all this has cast a pall over columbia savings & loan association and its <unk> <unk> chairman thomas spiegel who built the $ N billion beverly hills calif. thrift with high-yield junk bonds 
 bears have targeted columbia 's stock because of the thrift 's exposure to the shaky junk market 
 and some investors fault mr. spiegel 's life style he earns millions of dollars a year and flies around in columbia 's jet planes 
 columbia stock recently hit N N after reaching N N earlier this year on rumors that mr. spiegel would take the thrift private 
 moreover junk professionals think columbia 's huge third-quarter <unk> of its junk portfolio to $ N billion was n't enough meaning another <unk> could be coming 
 but in recent days columbia has edged up closing at N N up N yesterday on revived speculation that the thrift might restructure 
 mr. spiegel 's fans say columbia 's southern california branches are highly <unk> and the thrift has $ N million of shareholders equity underlying its assets 
 that 's almost $ N of equity for each columbia share including convertible preferred shares though more junk <unk> would reduce the cushion 
 columbia has only about N million common shares in public hands 
 the spiegel family has N N of the common and N N of the votes 
 other big common holders are carl <unk> 's american financial investor <unk> jacobs and pacific financial research though the latter cut its stake this summer 
 while many problems would attend a restructuring of columbia investors say mr. spiegel is <unk> such a plan to <unk> columbia 's junk problems 
 indeed columbia executives recently told reporters they were interested in creating a separate unit to hold columbia 's junk bonds and perhaps do merchant banking 
 columbia wo n't comment on all the speculation 
 but like other thrifts it 's expected to seek regulators ' consent to create a distinct junk-bond entity 
 plans to do this are due to be filed in a week or so 
 new rules force thrifts to write down their junk to market value then sell the bonds over five years 
 that 's why columbia just wrote off $ N million of its junk and reserved $ N million for future junk losses 
 but if columbia could keep its junk bonds separate from the thrift till they mature at full value unless the issuer goes <unk> or <unk> the junk portfolio might do all right 
 columbia a longtime drexel client wo n't provide current data on its junk 
 but its N big junk holdings at year end showed only a few bonds that have been really battered 
 these were allied stores western union telegraph gillett holdings sci television and texas air though many other bonds in columbia 's portfolio also have lost value 
 possibly offsetting that columbia recently estimated it has <unk> gains on publicly traded equity investments of more than $ N million 
 it also hopes for ultimate gains of as much as $ N million on equity investments in buy-outs and restructurings 
 one trial balloon mr. spiegel is said to have <unk> to investors columbia might be broken up as mellon bank was split into a good bank and a bad bank 
 but columbia 's good bank would be a regulated thrift while the bad bank would be a private investment company holding some of columbia 's junk bonds real estate and equity investments 
 some think columbia 's thrift which now is seeking a new chief operating officer might be capitalized at say $ N million and <unk> to a commercial bank that wants a california presence 
 the thrift surely could be sold for more than the value of its equity financial industry executives say 
 meanwhile the bad bank with the junk bonds and some capital might be spun off to columbia shareholders including mr. spiegel who might then have a new career investors say 
 it is n't clear how much a restructuring would help columbia stockholders 
 but the concept is <unk> 
 you sell the good bank as an ongoing operation and use some of the proceeds to capitalize the bad bank says thrift specialist lewis <unk> of <unk> associates in new york 
 mr. spiegel 's next career move is a subject of speculation on wall street 
 few people think mr. spiegel wants to run a bread-and-butter thrift which current rules would force columbia to become 
 they are n't really a thrift says jonathan gray a sanford c. bernstein analyst 
 of course regulators would have to approve columbia 's reorganization 
 and some investment bankers say a restructuring is n't <unk> while the sec still is <unk> mr. spiegel 's past junk-bond trades

 the bush administration 's nomination of <unk> thomas to a seat on the federal appeals court here received a blow this week when the american bar association gave mr. thomas only a qualified rating rather than well qualified 
 people familiar with the senate judiciary committee which will vote on the nomination said some liberal members of the panel are likely to question the aba rating in hearings on the matter 
 mr. thomas currently chairman of the equal employment opportunity commission would add another conservative voice to the closely divided court 
 groups have accused him of <unk> policies that narrowed rights of older workers and of ignoring discrimination by large companies 
 <unk> members of the house with jurisdiction over the <unk> have said they oppose mr. thomas 's nomination because of serious questions about his judgment and respect for the law 
 a senior justice department official however said the administration is n't worried about the aba rating 
 we 're pleased the aba rated him qualified david runkel the department 's chief spokesman said in an interview 
 the aba gives a qualified rating to <unk> it believes would perform <unk> on the bench

 the move is part of a strategy to focus on its core metals trading processing and plant engineering activities while shedding peripheral units the company said 
 <unk> had N sales of N million marks $ N million and has a current order backlog of N billion marks 
 the sale comes in place of a planned initial public offering of <unk> stock 
 a plan to bring the stock to market before year end apparently was upset by the recent weakness of frankfurt share prices 
 the u.s. international trade commission issued preliminary rulings under the u.s. <unk> act that imports of <unk> from hong kong taiwan and south korea may be <unk> a domestic industry 
 because of the rulings the commerce department will continue to investigate complaints by u.s. <unk> makers that the imports are reaching the u.s. at unfairly low prices in violation of the u.s. <unk> act 
 the law <unk> unfairly low prices as ones below the cost of production or below prices in an exporter 's home market 
 <unk> officials said final commerce department and <unk> rulings wo n't come until next march or later

 upjohn co. said it will offer an early retirement package to as many as N employees in a cost-cutting move expected to result in a fourth-quarter charge 
 upjohn officials said they could n't estimate the size of the charge until they determine which employees and how many will participate in the retirement plan 
 but the pharmaceutical company said it anticipates the long-term savings resulting from the plan 's <unk> will more than offset short-term costs 
 the program available to upjohn employees N years old or older could increase an individual 's retirement benefits N N to N N 
 in addition upjohn is offering a one-time retirement bonus equal to six months of base pay 
 chairman <unk> <unk> called the program part of the company 's two-year strategy to implement budget constraints and an effective <unk> program 
 but some analysts questioned how much of an impact the retirement package will have because few jobs will end up being eliminated 
 it 's a cosmetic move said jonathan s. <unk> of wertheim schroder & co 
 according to upjohn 's estimates only N N to N N of the N eligible employees will take advantage of the plan 
 upjohn further estimated that about N N of the employees who leave for early retirement may be replaced 
 as a result upjohn will likely trim only about N to N of its more than N jobs world-wide 
 in composite trading on the new york stock exchange yesterday upjohn shares rose N cents to $ N apiece 
 an upjohn spokesman said he had heard nothing to suggest the early retirement package was spurred by shareholder pressure or a potential bidder for the company which occasionally has been the target of takeover speculation 
 the company earlier this year adopted a <unk> plan to ward off unwanted suitors 
 the spokesman said it is the first early retirement plan offered under its two-year <unk> strategy

 although started in N wedtech did n't really get rolling until N when mr. neuberger discovered the federal government 's section N a minority business program 
 this is a <unk> great society creation that <unk> certain government contracts be awarded <unk> to minority businesses 
 mr. neuberger realized that although of italian <unk> mr. <unk> still could qualify as a minority person since he was born in puerto rico 
 the two partners merely had to <unk> the true ownership of the corporation 
 instead of N it became on paper only two-thirds <unk> one-third neuberger and they were in the program and off to the races 
 besides being a <unk> company wedtech was located in the south bronx a <unk> area made famous by <unk> carter in his N presidential campaign

 starting with congressman mario <unk> now serving a jail sentence the company began a career of <unk> federal state and local public officials and those close to public officials right up to and including e. robert <unk> close friend and adviser to former attorney general ed <unk> 
 wedtech did n't just use old <unk> bribery

 numerous other scandals among them the ones at hud have the same <unk> as wedtech 
 they take place in government programs that seem <unk> for corruption 
 why are programs like this not eliminated 
 feeding frenzy does provide a few clues 
 in and around all levels of government in the u.s. are groups of people who can best be described as <unk> to a political insider commercial party 
 they know that whenever government is <unk> wealth <unk> commerce or maintaining a large defense establishment there is big money to be made in <unk> <unk> or selling the processes and decisions of government 
 they are our version of the east bloc 's <unk> and they have absolutely no wish to see anything change 
 how many government programs and policies exist because they line the pockets of political insiders

 the battery plant which makes <unk> nickel <unk> and carbon <unk> products will be closed over the next year or so a spokesman said

 the record <unk> binge by the soviet union is causing serious <unk> in the u.s. grain pipeline 
 the soviet purchases are so massive that exporters are struggling to find enough river <unk> and trains to move the recently <unk> midwest crop to ports for <unk> onto soviet ships 
 river <unk> rates have soared N N this fall from a year earlier 
 railroad companies and some ports are <unk> a sudden <unk> of business 
 and some grain analysts are predicting that corn prices might <unk> this month as exporters <unk> to find enough of the crop to meet their obligations to the soviets 
 the soviet union bought roughly N million <unk> of u.s. corn in october which is the most ever sold to the soviet union in one month from the u.s. 
 the soviet union wants much of it delivered by january which would be a strain in most years 
 but it is particularly difficult this autumn because of low water levels on the mississippi river on which flows much of the u.s. corn that is shipped overseas 
 we are shipping the most corn in that short of time period to one customer on record said william <unk> a u.s. agriculture department transportation expert 
 it is going to be real tight 
 because of persistent dry weather in the northern plains the water level on the upper section of the mississippi river is so low that many river operators are already trimming the number of <unk> their <unk> push at one time 
 in a few weeks many <unk> probably wo n't be able to operate fully loaded south of st. louis because the u.s. army corps of engineers is beginning to reduce the flow of the missouri river which feeds into the mississippi river 
 the army corps is cutting the flow of the missouri river about two weeks earlier than normal because of low water levels in the <unk> that feed it 
 <unk> rates on the mississippi river sank yesterday on speculation that widespread rain this week in the midwest might temporarily alleviate the situation 
 but the army corps of engineers expects the river level to continue falling this month 
 at st. louis the water level of the mississippi river is already N feet below normal and it could drop an additional N feet when the flow of the missouri river is slowed an army corps spokesman said 
 similar levels <unk> <unk> shipments last year in the wake of the worst drought in N years 
 so far the grain industry 's <unk> <unk> problems have n't been a major factor in the trading of corn contracts at the chicago board of trade 
 many grain processors and exporters use the price of the corn futures contracts traded there to calculate the price they offer to buy corn from farmers 
 at the board of trade yesterday the price of the corn contract for december delivery slipped N cents a bushel to settle at $ N a bushel 
 corn prices have been sluggish this fall despite the huge soviet orders because the harvest has allowed farmers to rebuild the <unk> <unk> by the N drought 
 with the harvest <unk> down however some analysts are <unk> that prices might jump in some regions as u.s. exporters try to gather the corn they are obligated to deliver 
 farmers are in the best position of many years to push up corn prices 
 because the drought reduced u.s. <unk> they have more than enough storage space for their new crop and that permits them to wait for prices to rise 
 in parts of iowa for example some grain elevators are offering farmers $ N a bushel for corn 
 many farmers probably would n't sell until prices rose at least N cents a bushel said <unk> reed president of chicago central & pacific railroad co. of <unk> iowa 
 it is n't clear however who would win a waiting game 
 although u.s. corn <unk> shrank by roughly half in the wake of the drought the agriculture department projects that nearly <unk> of the harvest will still be in storage before the N corn harvest begins 
 some analysts are worried that reports of the grain industry 's problems might spark investors to begin buying corn futures contracts only to see little appreciation 
 the public is buying the market when in reality there is plenty of grain to be shipped said bill <unk> <unk> inc. research director 
 although much of this country 's export corn goes to new orleans by <unk> it is possible for exporters to <unk> the mississippi river by shipping a <unk> amount of corn by train to the port 
 ports in the great <unk> and atlantic coast can also relieve pressure on new orleans 
 one railroad for example is already increasing its grain <unk> service from indiana to baltimore 
 and it is n't clear that the soviet union will stay on its record buying pace 
 the soviet orders were <unk> into the month of october because of delays 
 the soviet union usually begins buying u.s. crops earlier in the fall 
 but its purchases apparently were delayed by a reorganization of its agricultural bureaucracy as well as budget problems

 precious metals gold in particular currently are being influenced more by stock market gyrations than the dollar as traders seek greater investment stability according to william <unk> vice president of research at elders futures in new york 
 the recent rally in precious metals was a result of uncertainty and volatility in equities he said 
 yesterday the stock market rose strongly creating a more defensive attitude among precious metals traders he said 
 silver and platinum which have more of an industrial nature than gold were even weaker he said 
 silver is also under pressure of extremely high inventories in warehouses of the commodity exchange he said 
 yesterday these stocks rose by N ounces to a record of N ounces according to an exchange spokesman 
 copper futures prices partially recovered monday 's declines because <unk> miners voted to strike 
 the december contract rose N cents a pound to $ N 
 in chile workers at two copper mines los <unk> and el <unk> which belong to the <unk> <unk> <unk> yesterday voted to begin a full strike tomorrow an analyst said 
 reasons for the <unk> the analyst said included a number of procedural issues such as a right to strike 
 the analyst noted that also inherent in all metal markets was a sympathetic reaction to stocks 
 in the case of copper he said the upbeat mood of stocks was reflected in demand for futures contracts because a stronger economy means greater buying interest for the metal 
 also contributing to the <unk> in copper the analyst noted was a report by chicago purchasing agents which <unk> the full purchasing agents ' report that is due out today and gives an indication of what the full report might hold 
 the purchasing management association of chicago 's october index rose to N N after three previous months of <unk> below N N 
 the september index was N N 
 a reading below N N generally indicates a slowing in the industrial sector of the economy while a reading above N N points to expansion 
 the chicago report raised the possibility that the october survey of the national association of purchasing management would also show a reading above N N

 usx corp. posted a N N drop in third-quarter profit as improved oil results failed to offset weakness in steel and natural gas operations 
 the nation 's largest steelmaker earned $ N million or N cents a share compared with the year-earlier $ N million or N cents a share 
 the recent quarter includes pretax gains of $ N million from asset sales while like gains in the year-earlier quarter totaled $ N million 
 in the N period usx also had a $ N million after-tax gain from a tax dispute settlement 
 sales rose N N to $ N billion from $ N billion 
 the earnings drop appears particularly steep in comparison with last year 's unusually strong third quarter when the company was riding an industrywide boom in demand and pricing 
 however third-quarter operating profit fell N N as usx sold sizable chunks of its diversified and steel segments eliminating income from those operations 
 among segments that continue to operate though the company 's steel division continued to suffer from soft demand for its <unk> goods serving the oil industry and other markets 
 peter marcus an analyst with painewebber inc. said that a downturn in the <unk> industry coupled with sluggish automotive sales hurt usx results 
 moreover usx exports more than other steelmakers and the overseas market has been under more severe pricing pressure 
 the company attributed lower sales and earnings for the steel segment to the loss of results from the <unk> ohio plant which now is a N joint venture with japan 's kobe steel ltd 
 in the steel division operating profit dropped N N to $ N million 
 profit per ton of steel shipped dropped to about $ N a ton from $ N a ton last year and $ N a ton in the second quarter analysts said 
 still usx fared better than other major steelmakers earning more per ton of steel shipped than either bethlehem steel corp. which posted a N N drop in net income or inland steel industries inc. whose profit plummeted N N 
 in new york stock exchange composite trading yesterday usx shares closed up $ N at $ N as the reported earnings exceeded projections by some analysts who had n't expected as great a volume of asset sales 
 the rise in the stock 's price may also reflect the fact that usx 's steel segment fared better than some other steelmakers ' 
 charles bradford an analyst with merrill lynch capital markets said usx may have received orders lost by competitors who were involved in labor contracts earlier this year 
 he said usx also appeared to sell a richer mix of steel products such as the more profitable pipe and galvanized coated sheet than <unk> structural goods 
 the energy segment with a N N rise in operating profit is clearly the company 's strongest 
 higher crude oil prices helped boost operating profit for the marathon oil co. unit to $ N million from $ N million

 proceeds of that sale are to be used to reduce debt and buy back shares 
 the company noted that it has reduced debt by $ N billion since the end of N and bought back about N million shares of common stock since the fourth quarter of N 
 usx has about $ N billion in long-term debt and N million shares outstanding 
 the announced sale of the reserves was followed by news that investor carl icahn had increased his stake in usx to N N and threatened a takeover or other business combination 
 mr. icahn has said he believes usx would be worth more if broken up into steel and energy segments

 professors philip <unk> of the university of chicago and laurence tribe of harvard law school said any effort by president bush to claim authority for a line-item veto would <unk> the text of the constitution and the intent of its authors as well as the views of previous presidents 
 a line-item veto is a procedure that would allow a president to veto part of a big congressional spending bill without having to scuttle the entire measure 
 mr. bush has said he would like to be able to use this procedure 
 a white house spokesman said last week that the president is considering declaring that the constitution <unk> gives him the authority for a line-item veto to <unk> a test case 
 but the two legal experts responding to an inquiry by sen. edward kennedy d. mass. wrote in a joint letter that the president lacks the constitutional authority to exercise a line-item veto 
 the two professors represent different ends of the political spectrum mr. <unk> is a conservative and mr. tribe is a liberal 
 the two professors said the constitution <unk> the president to veto entire bills not partial measures 
 moreover they said the first appropriations bill passed N years ago covered many different items and there was no discussion of a line-item veto 
 they also said that more than a dozen presidents have called for line-item veto authority since the civil war and all have shared the view that such <unk> power is beyond the reach of the president 
 sen. kennedy said in a separate statement that he supports legislation to give the president line-item veto power but that it would be a reckless course of action for president bush to claim the authority without congressional approval

 a sec proposal to ease reporting requirements for some company executives would undermine the <unk> of information on insider trades as a <unk> tool individual investors and professional money managers contend 
 they make the argument in letters to the agency about rule changes proposed this past summer that among other things would exempt many <unk> executives from reporting trades in their own companies ' shares 
 the proposed changes also would allow executives to report exercises of options later and less often 
 many of the letters maintain that investor confidence has been so shaken by the N stock market crash and the markets already so <unk> against the little guy that any decrease in information on insider-trading patterns might prompt individuals to get out of stocks altogether 
 the sec has historically paid <unk> to the ideal of a level playing field wrote <unk> s. <unk> of <unk> ill. in one of the N letters the agency has received since the changes were proposed aug. N 
 apparently the commission did not really believe in this ideal 
 currently the rules force executives directors and other corporate insiders to report purchases and sales of their companies ' shares within about a month after the transaction 
 but about N N of the insiders according to sec figures file their reports late 
 the changes were proposed in an effort to streamline federal bureaucracy and boost compliance by the executives who are really calling the shots said brian lane special counsel at the sec 's office of disclosure policy which proposed the changes 
 investors money managers and corporate officials had until today to comment on the proposals and the issue has produced more mail than almost any other issue in memory mr. lane said 
 the sec will probably vote on the proposal early next year he said 
 not all those who wrote oppose the changes 
 the committee on federal regulation of securities for the american bar association argues for example in its lengthy letter to the sec that the proposed changes would substantially improve the law by <unk> it more closely to contemporary business realities 
 what the investors who oppose the proposed changes object to most is the effect they say the proposal would have on their ability to spot <unk> <unk> of trading activity buying or selling by more than one officer or director within a short period of time 
 according to some estimates the rule changes would cut insider filings by more than a third 
 the sec 's mr. lane <unk> disputed those estimates 
 the rules will eliminate filings <unk> divisions such as sales marketing finance and research and development mr. lane said 
 the proposed rules also would be tougher on the insiders still required to file reports he said 
 companies would be <unk> to publish in annual proxy statements the names of insiders who fail to file reports on time 
 considered as a whole mr. lane said the filings required under the proposed rules will be at least as effective if not more so for investors following transactions 
 but robert <unk> president of <unk> a north miami fla. company that packages and sells the insider-trading data said the proposal is <unk> so <unk> that key officials may fail to file the reports 
 many investors wrote asking the sec to require insiders to report their purchases and sales immediately not a month later 
 but mr. lane said that while the sec <unk> who files the law tells them when to do so 
 investors who want to change the required timing should write their representatives in congress he added 
 the sec would likely be <unk> to legislation that required insiders to file transactions on a more timely basis he said

 solo <unk> players have to be creative if they want to work a lot because their <unk> and audience appeal are limited 
 the <unk> <unk> <unk> has taken a hard line about the problem he commissions and <unk> <unk> <unk> contemporary scores and does some conducting so he does n't have to play the same <unk> and <unk> <unk> over and over again 
 richard stoltzman has taken a <unk> more <unk> approach 
 years ago he <unk> with the new music <unk> peter <unk> and fred <unk> in the very <unk> chamber group <unk> which won audiences over to <unk> contemporary scores like <unk> 's <unk> for the end of time 
 today the <unk> <unk> has mostly dropped the <unk> work though a touch of the old <unk> still <unk> and now goes on the road with piano bass a slide show and a <unk> that ranges from light classical to light jazz to light pop with a few notable exceptions 
 just the thing for the <unk> set the <unk> audience that has embraced new age as its very own easy listening 
 but you ca n't dismiss mr. stoltzman 's music or his <unk> as merely commercial and <unk> 
 he believes in what he plays and he plays <unk> 
 his recent appearance at the metropolitan museum dubbed a musical <unk> was a case in point 
 it felt more like a party or a highly <unk> <unk> session with a few friends than a classical concert 
 <unk> in his trademark black <unk> suit the <unk> <unk> announced that his new <unk> inner voices had just been released that his family was in the front row and that it was his mother 's birthday so he was going to play her favorite tune from the record 
 he launched into <unk> 's the <unk> from carnival of the animals a favorite <unk> piece for <unk> with lovely glossy tone and no <unk> 
 then as if to show that he could play fast as well he offered the second movement from <unk> 's <unk> for <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> that reflected the <unk> side of the stoltzman <unk> 
 and so it went through the first half an <unk> chosen <unk> of pieces none longer than five minutes none that would <unk> or challenge a <unk> 
 mr. stoltzman introduced his colleagues bill douglas <unk> and an old buddy from yale and jazz <unk> eddie <unk> 
 an <unk> section was built around pieces by mr. douglas beginning with golden rain a <unk> <unk> lead in to the <unk> sky which gave mr. stoltzman the opportunity to <unk> in a high register and show off his fleet fingers 
 <unk> 's air followed 
 mr. stoltzman tied the <unk> in by <unk> him the great <unk> of the <unk> century and then built on the image by joining with mr. douglas in some <unk> two-part <unk> <unk> arranged for <unk> and <unk> by mr. douglas 
 keeping the mood light the two then <unk> and <unk> their way through some <unk> <unk> devised by mr. douglas as an alternative to <unk> 's dry <unk> techniques and then with mr. <unk> soared and <unk> on the <unk> 's tight <unk> <unk> 
 the end of the first half however brought what the <unk> crowd seemed to be waiting for the pop singer <unk> collins who appears on inner voices 
 glamorous and <unk> as ever ms. collins sang <unk> mitchell 's for free about an <unk> with a <unk> <unk> to which mr. stoltzman contributed a <unk> <unk> and mr. douglas 's <unk> setting of a <unk> blessing deep peace 
 deep peace also featured a slide show of lovely but predictable images of clouds <unk> <unk> <unk> etc 
 it was all too <unk> to be believed but they probably would have gotten away with it had they not felt <unk> to add ms. collins 's signature tune amazing grace and ask for audience participation 
 that went over the permissible line for warm and <unk> feelings 
 was this why some of the audience <unk> before or during the second half 
 or was it because ms. collins had gone 
 either way it was a <unk> because mr. <unk> offered the most substantial music of the evening just after <unk> steve reich 's new york <unk> one of a series of reich works that <unk> a live performer with recorded tracks of his or her own playing 
 mr. reich 's new different trains for string <unk> uses the technique <unk> 
 mr. stoltzman must have worried that his audience might not be able to take it he warned us in advance that new york <unk> lasts N N minutes 
 he also unfortunately illustrated this <unk> <unk> <unk> with mr. <unk> 's images this time of <unk> or <unk> <unk> in a <unk> <unk> of the musical structure that was <unk> <unk> from mr. reich 's piece and mr. stoltzman 's elegant execution of it 
 the rest of the concert was more straight jazz and <unk> sounds written by charlie parker <unk> coleman bill douglas and eddie <unk> with pictures for the douglas pieces 
 it was <unk> to hear accomplished jazz without having to sit in a <unk> club but like the first half much of it was easy to take and ultimately <unk> 
 is this the future of chamber music 
 managers and <unk> insist that chamber music <unk> are a hard sell but can audiences really enjoy them only if the music is <unk> of threatening elements served up in <unk> <unk> and accompanied by <unk> 
 what 's next 
 <unk> to illustrate <unk> <unk> 
 it was not an <unk> evening certainly thanks to the high level of performance the <unk> <unk> of mr. douglas and the obvious <unk> with which mr. stoltzman chooses his <unk> 
 but it was neither deep nor lasting light entertainment that was no substitute for an evening of <unk>
